{"title": "Delhi govt departments distance themselves from AAP’s promised schemes; ask people not to share personal details", "text": "The Delhi government’s Women and Child Development and Health departments issued public notices on Wednesday (December 25, 2024) distancing themselves from the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s promised schemes of providing ₹2,100 to women and free treatment for the elderly, triggering a fresh row ahead of Assembly polls.\nThe two departments also cautioned the people against providing personal details to anyone on the pretext of registration for “non-existent” schemes, saying any private individual or political party collecting such physical forms or information is “fraudulent and without any authority”.\nThe development, which came days after AAP leaders launched the exercise of registering people for the Mukhya Mantri Mahila Samman Yojana and Sanjeevani Yojana with much fanfare, left the AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal furious.\nMr. Kejriwal, who is leading the registration drive, alleged that the BJP was rattled by the two schemes and claimed that Chief Minister Atishi could be arrested in a “fake” case in the coming days.\n“They are completely rattled with Mahila Samman Yojna and Sanjeevani Yojna. They have hatched a plan to come up with a fake case and arrest Chief Minister Atishi in the next few days,” he said on X.\nHe also claimed that before CM Atishi’s arrest, raids would be conducted against senior AAP leaders.\nBJP MP Bansuri Swaraj had on Tuesday (December 24, 2024) claimed that she spoke to the Health Secretary of the Delhi government and was informed that there was no “Sanjeevani Yojna” in existence.\nBoth the schemes were announced by Mr. Kejriwal ahead of Assembly polls in February next year and AAP had started registrations for the schemes in campaign mode. Its leaders are confident that the measure will help woo voters as many believe that such schemes were a factor in the ruling parties retaining power in several State elections.\n“It has been brought to the notice of the Department of Women and Child Development, through media reports and social media posts, that a political party is claiming to disburse ₹2100 per month under Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana to women in Delhi. It is clarified that no such scheme has been notified by the Government of Delhi,” said the public notice by the department.\n“If and when the scheme begins, the department will launch a digital portal for eligible individuals to submit their applications online as per the approved guidelines,” it said.\n“Since no such scheme exists, the question of physical forms for registration under this non-existent scheme does not arise,” read the notice.\n“Any private individual/ political party collecting such physical forms/applications or collecting information from applicants under the name of the Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana is fraudulent and without any authority,” it said.\nThe notice cautioned the people that providing personal details and sensitive information like PAN account numbers, phone numbers or Voter ID, in the name of the scheme may lead to crime including cyber and banking frauds.\nIt advised people not to entertain the “misleading” promise of non- non-existent scheme and to exercise caution and asked them not to provide personal details to unauthorised persons.\nThe Mahila Samman Yojna was announced by the AAP government in the budget 2024-25 to provide ₹1000 per month to all eligible women aged above 18 in Delhi. Kejriwal recently promised to raise the amount to ₹2100 per woman if AAP returned to power.\nThe Health and Family Department public notice similarly cautioned the people about “Sanjeevani Yojna” announced by the AAP supremo for free treatment of senior citizens above 60 years at government and private hospitals.\nIt has also come to the notice of the department that a registration drive to get enrolled under this scheme by filling up physical forms has also been started by some political functionaries and volunteers who are visiting door to door to collect information from elderly citizens and handing over to them some sort of “Health/Sanjeevani Scheme Card”.\nThe notice said details of senior citizens like phone numbers, addresses, Aadhar and bank accounts were being sought for the registration and many of the elderly people have started visiting government hospitals and government offices to enquire about the scheme.\nThe notice said the Health and Family department does not have any supposed “Sanjeevani Scheme” in existence till date.\n“Any private individual/political party collecting such physical forms/ applications or collecting information of applicants under the name of “Sanjeevani Yojna” is fraudulent and without any authority,” read the notice clarifying the department has not authorised any health officials to collect personal details of the elderly.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-govt-departments-distance-themselves-from-aaps-promised-schemes-ask-people-not-to-share-personal-details/article69025618.ece", "authors": [], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T06:49:55", "language": "en", "description": "Delhi govt distances from AAP's promised schemes, warns against sharing personal details for non-existent programs."},{"title": "Telugu cinema 2024: Beyond 'Kalki 2898 AD‘ and ‘Pushpa 2: The Rule', the surprises and misses", "text": "In 2024, Telugu cinema delivered two blockbusters — Kalki 2898 AD and Pushpa 2: The Rule — that crossed the 1000-crore mark at the box office. A few surprises came in the form of small and medium budget films that gave the audiences and the industry reasons to cheer. Despite this, it was a middling year for Telugu cinema. Over several weeks many new releases failed to generate footfalls in theatres. Nearly 250 Telugu films released in theatres of which, only 15 to 20 were box office successes.\nThe biggies\nStories from the Mahabharata became a talking point after director Nag Ashwin’s Kalki 2898 AD was released. The sequel is expected to throw more light on the world of the Supreme Yaskin (Kamal Haasan), the redemption of Ashwatthama (Amitabh Bachchan), Karna (Prabhas), and of course, the birth of Kalki.\nDirector Sukumar’s Pushpa 2: The Rule capitalised on the popularity of the first film, Pushpa: The Rise, for which Allu Arjun bagged the National Award for Best Actor. The sequel was tailor-made for mass cinema-loving audiences and ended, albeit abruptly, with the announcement of Pushpa 3: The Rampage.\nGuntur Kaaram, director Trivikram Srinivas and Mahesh Babu’s collaboration a decade after Khaleja, drew mixed response for its lackadaisical screenplay.\nSankranti 2024’s surprise winner was director Prasanth Varma’s Hanu-Man. The story of an underdog gaining superpowers from lord Hanuman made for an entertaining film. In the age of marketing hype and increased ticket prices driving the box office, Hanu-Man was a reminder that a film will have wide acceptance if it strikes a chord with the audiences.\nDirector Koratala Siva and Jr. NTR’s Devara — their second collaboration after Janatha Garage — tried to capture the nationwide box office, following the actor’s increased popularity post-RRR. The overstretched action drama ended with the announcement of a sequel.\nSequel fatigue\nIn the post-Baahubali era, as more big-budget films vie for their share of large box office pies, there has been an increase in larger-than-life stories that involve meticulous world-building, numerous characters and subplots designed with the scope for franchises. Post-release posters may boast several hundred crore box office collections, but that audiences are getting weary of sequels is undeniable.\nFilms worth recommending\n35: Chinna Katha Kaadu, Hanu-Man, Saripodhaa Sanivaaram, Lucky Baskhar, KA, Gaami, Mathu Vadalara 2, Tillu Square, Kalki 2898 AD, Pushpa 2: The Rule.\nWeb series\nParuvu, Brinda, 90’s: A Middle Class Biopic.\nFun sequels\nTwo sequels that were runaway hits were the comedies Tillu Square and Mathu Vadalara 2. Actor-writer Siddhu Jonnalagadda’s Tillu Square, directed by Mallik Ram, smartly tapped into the audience’s familiarity of the first film. The collective cheer in the halls ensured that Tillu was not a one-time wonder. Director Ritesh Rana’s comic thriller Mathu Vadalara 2 was helped hugely by the inimitable Satya delivering some of the wittiest lines this year. As he says, ‘don’t book a judge by its cover!’\nSummer woes\nIn pre-pandemic years, summer holidays were synonymous with star-studded releases that could draw audiences in large numbers, to theatres. In contrast, summer 2024 nearly drew a blank. The absence of films starring A-listers could have worked as opportunity for small and medium-budget films, but most summer releases barely generated interest. The IPL cricket matches and elections were cited as reasons for a few postponements. Several single screen theatres in Telangana closed for a fortnight citing dwindling footfalls.\nThe new order\nDebut filmmakers made a mark with compelling storylines. Nanda Kishore Emani’s family drama 35: Chinna Katha Kaadu, Yadhu Vamsi’s nostalgic story of friendships Committee Kurrollu that touched upon caste systems, Sujith and Sandeep’s thriller drama KA and Vidyadhar Kagita’s soul-searching journey Gaami are a few examples. Dushyanth Katikaneni’s Ambajipeta Marriage Band, Anji Maniputra’s Aay, Ajay Nag’s Aarambham, Neelagiri Mamilla’s Peka Medalu and Anurag Palutla’s Veeranjaneyulu Vihara Yatra also deserve a mention.\nGenre game\nDirector Venky Atluri’s Lucky Baskhar and Eashvar Karthick’s Zebra presented financial thrillers, a less-explored domain. The former gave Dulquer his third consecutive blockbuster in Telugu while the latter gave Satyadev reason to cheer.\nAction entertainers dominated the narratives among the bigger films. Director Vivek Athreya’s Saripodhaa Sanivaaram, starring Nani and SJ Suryah, veered away from the cliches associated with the genre and delivered rousing moments that were delineated by smart writing. Anger pervaded as a mood rather than gory violence.\nRomantic comedies were conspicuous by their absence.\nNostalgic settings\nSeveral of this year’s hits such as Committee Kurrollu, KA and Lucky Baskhar opted for a nostalgic setting in the 1980s and 90s. While it worked in favour of these films, Gangs of Godavari, Mr Bachchan and Matka failed to make an impression.\nGender sensitivity\nActor Sree Vishnu and writer-director Hasith Goli deserve a pat on their backs for the sensitive portrayal of a transgender character in Swag, a satirical commentary on patriarchal and matriarchal societies.\nIn director Sree Harsha Konuganti’s horror comedy Om Bheem Bush which also starred Sree Vishnu, a surprise came in the form of a sensitive romance featuring a transgender artiste, played by dancer Manish Kumar.\nFemale perspective\nThe Kajal Aggarwal starrer Satyabhama and Yevam starring Chandini Choudary had stories about a female cop but both did not utilise their complete potential.\nDirector Surya Manoj Vangala’s web series Brinda, headlined by a restrained and effective Trisha, was a taut psychological thriller in which a female police officer battles the demons of her past and solves a puzzling crime.\nIn 35: Chinna Katha Kaadu, Nivetha Thomas excelled in portraying a homemaker who guides her young son pass an examination, a task that warrants her to rise above her limitations.\nRashmika Mandanna as Srivalli in Pushpa 2: The Rule asserted herself in the male-dominated story of a smuggling syndicate. Her monologue during the Gangamma jatara sequence proves she can take on author-backed characters.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/telugu-cinema-2024-blockbusters-surprises-and-several-misses/article69018762.ece", "authors": ["Sangeetha Devi Dundoo"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T06:49:52", "language": "en", "description": "Telugu cinema in 2024 saw blockbusters, surprises, and disappointments, with a mix of big-budget and small films."},{"title": "Two persons sexually assault Anna University student on campus", "text": "Two persons allegedly sexually assaulted an Anna University student on the varsity campus on Tuesday (December 24, 2024) night.

weaponising judiciary for carrying out ‘political witch hunt’", "text": "Sajeeb Wazed, son of deposed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has accused the Muhammad Yunus led interim government of “weaponising the judiciary” for carrying out a “political witch hunt” against the Awami League leadership.\nMr. Wazed’s allegations, as a long post on X, came two days after the interim government on Monday (December 25, 2024) said it has sent a diplomatic note to New Delhi seeking Ms. Hasina’s extradition from India.\nMs. Hasina (77) has been living in India since August 5 when she fled Bangladesh following a massive student-led protest that toppled her Awami League's (AL) 16-year regime.\nBangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued arrest warrants for Ms. Hasina and several former Cabinet Ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for “crimes against humanity and genocide.”\n“The judges and prosecutors appointed by unelected Yunus led regime to conduct farcical trial process through International Crimes Tribunal makes it a political witch hunt that forsakes justice and marks another ongoing onslaught to persecute Awami League leadership,” Mr. Wazed said in his post on Tuesday (December 24, 2024).\nAn IT entrepreneur, Mr. Wazed is based in the U.S. and has been an ICT adviser in Ms. Hasina’s government.\n“The kangaroo tribunal and subsequent request for extradition comes while hundreds of leaders and activists are extrajudicially killed, framing of outrageous murder charges, illegal incarceration of thousands by law enforcement and violent attacks including looting vandalism and arson going on with impunity everyday fuelled by denial of the regime,” he added.\nOn Monday (December 23, 2024), India confirmed receiving the ‘note verbale’ or diplomatic communication from the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi but refrained from commenting on it.\nUnder the provisions of the India-Bangladesh extradition treaty, extradition may be refused if the offence is one of a “political character.”\nBangladesh's de facto Foreign Minister Touhid Hossain said Dhaka wants Ms. Hasina back to face the judicial process.\nMr. Wazed further accused that the chief prosecutor of ICT Tribunal Tajul Islam appointed by Mr. Yunus regime on December 22, despite proven records of defending war criminals, “reportedly spread deliberate disinformation campaign” against Ms. Hasina by claiming that Interpol issued red notice against her, and termed it as “a desperate bid to extradite her and hold farcical trial to serve the interest of Dr. Yunus.”\n“But the very prosecutor later altered his statement following media exposure of the outright lie and now officially sent a request to India for the extradition,” Ms. Hasina’s son said.\n“We reiterate our position that every single incident of human rights violation between July and August needs to be investigated in a free and fair manner but the Yunus led regime weaponised the judiciary, and we express no confidence in the justice system,” he alleged.\nLast month, in an address to the nation on the completion of 100 days of the interim government, Mr. Yunus said Bangladesh will seek Ms. Hasina’s extradition. “We must ensure justice in every killing… We will also ask India to send back fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina,” he had said then.\nMr. Yunus, who assumed office on August 8, claimed that about 1,500 people, including students and workers, were killed while 19,931 others were wounded during the protest against the Ms. Hasina government.\nIndia has expressed concern as there have been a spate of attacks on minorities including on the Hindu community in Bangladesh in the last few months.\nIn recent weeks, Ms. Hasina has accused the Mr. Yunus-led

Sip. Swirl. Sip. Savour.\nRepeat.\nKRSMA was hosting a vertical tasting and there was an alluring array of wines from their cellars. Vertical tastings are where one gets to sip on wines of the same varietal from different vintages, and are relatively rare in India.\nAccording to Uma Chigurupati, co-founder of KRSMA, the reason for introducing the concept of vertical tasting in India “is because people should know what is a vintage.” Founded in 2008, KRSMA’s vineyards are situated in Tavaregere, en route to Hampi, and celebrated its first harvest in 2010.\nAt the tasting which began with a Sauvignon Blanc 2024 as an apertif, KRSMA showcased how their Cabernet Sauvignon has evolved over the years, and “what it speaks about — whether it is full of tannins or less tannic, silky and delicate.”\nHow does one vintage differ from the other? “A vintage is a revelation on the transformation natural fruit goes through. Climate changes, the temperature, rainfall, terroir and similar factors play a part in the harvest in any given year. When we don’t tamper with the grapes, it speaks volumes about that vintage and what that particular year has been like.”\nElaborating on how one vintage differs from another, Uma shares how it is not uncommon to hear statements such as, ”This year is a great vintage,” in wine-drinking regions. “How wine evolves over a period of time is what one learns from the vintage. This is the reason why the price of a particular vintage goes up when compared to others, even though they might be from the same brand, grapes and vineyard.”\n“Differences in vintages can surprise you,” says Uma, adding, “For instance, when you open a Cabernet Sauvignon 2018 today, even after an aeration of a couple of hours, it is rather tight and opens up quite slowly. Whereas a Cabernet Sauvignon 2022, even though a fairly new wine, is ready to drink.”\n“It is interesting to see how much we can learn about the climate and other aspects, and their effect on vines and how they evolve.”\nSimilarly, Uma says the KRSMA’s Sauvignon Blanc 2024 is a wonderful vintage, “quite fruit forward, without too much greeness. It has rather tropical notes and a hint of floral fragrance, working well as an aperitif or paired with mildly flavored foods that enhance the character of the wine.”\nThough vertical tastings are rare in India, they are considered KRSMA’s flagship event since they first introduced the concept in Bengaluru in 2016. The brands current vintages include Cabernet Sauvignon 2018 and Sauvignon Blanc 2024.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/krsmas-vertical-tasting-showcases-evolution-of-their-cabernet-sauvignon/article68980589.ece", "authors": ["Ruth Dhanaraj"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T06:18:32", "language": "en", "description": "Karnataka’s wine makers KRSMA recently held a vertical tasting, offering a glimpse into the world of viniculture"},{"title": "Underground Comedy Club and Bengaluru’s shifting evening culture", "text": "Bengaluru many soon lose it’s moniker as the ‘pub capital of India,’ as both residents and visitors to the city make a beeline for stand-up shows. The ongoing month-long Underground Comedy Festival hosted by the Underground Comedy Club (UCC) is proof enough that humour has takers.\nThe comedy scene in Bengaluru, though still in a nascent stage, has already garnered a lot of attention. Forerunners such as That Comedy Club and Sherlock Club, despite their premature closing, set the stage for laughter as an acceptable way to spend an evening, and the city is now one of the highest ticket selling markets for any comedian.\nDiscussing the difference of performing in a club and a bar, Harman Preet Singh who is one of the co-founders of UCC, said it came down to one factor — alcohol. The distraction in bars and pubs are high and there is no dedicated space for the artistes to perform their material effectively. “A club provides a dedicated space for the comic and their audiences. There is no distraction. People enter, enjoy the show and keep coming back. It is a great space for introverts who do not feel out of place as everyone there is only for the show,” says Harman.\n“I believe the price of a drink can fetch you a better time for an hour at a show,” says Shreya Shankar, a regular at UCC.\nUCC’s start\nIn early 2023, Kartikeya Fatwani, one of the founders of UCC, pitched the idea of a comedy club in the city to Harman Preet Singh. “Initially, when he showed me the first location, I opted out of it. But when he called me again in September last year saying he found an underground space, I checked it out and fell in love with it instantly. I got my architect on board and UCC happened,” Harman said.\nUCC opened to the public with its first show on November 4, 2023. Ashish Solanki, a popular standup comedian and founder of the show, The Pretty Good Roast, says, “Performing at UCC feels like you are sharing secrets with a bunch of friends huddled around a fireplace. That atmosphere changes as the comic reveals himself and how the audience receives him.”\nGursimran Khamba, co-founder of All India Bakchod (AIB) and a popular standup comedian based out of Mumbai, seconds this. “UCC has a New York-club vibe and the audiences, too, have grown in their understanding of different types of comedy. You can instantly tell whether your set is working out or not since the audience is quite close to you”.\n“The constructive feedback by the audience is unique as the crowd is open to experiment, providing a great space for artistes,” says Sahil Agarwal, a regular at the club.\nPrashasti Singh, a popular standup comic from Mumbai says, “UCC is one of most fun places to perform at in India,” adding that the compliment is well-deserved as it packs the enthusiasm of both the audience and the artiste into a cosy space.\nQuality crowd\nWith a youth-led crowd, Bengaluru in general and UCC in particular, provides a great space for refreshment and entertainment. “It is also a great way to learn about the local culture,” says Sahil, who hails from Gurgaon.\n“Unlike in other cities, the crowds in Bengaluru are much better and offer new talent a safe space. The audience is quite supportive; if they don’t like your set, they will let you know, but not demotivate you,” says Shreya.\nHarman says UCC began a segment titled Killer Comic for the sole purpose of aiding budding comedians in developing their material. The registration fee is ₹150, and winners not only get a cash prize of ₹2500, but also a space at mics from Monday to Wednesday at UCC.\nBack talk\nIn the age of social media where reels and shorts have become a new marketing strategy, this concept provides potential audiences with a quick glimpse of the comedian’s style without giving away their whole act.\n“Crowd work is a segment comedians have been tapping into for the longest time. It has only come to the fore now, because of social media. Not every one has the skill to engage people in mundane conversations and make a career out it,” says Harman.\nIpsita, who has been frequenting UCC for a couple of months, says, “As a member of the audience I feel anyone can come up to the stage with a script, but a comedian pulling off an impromptu act, makes all the difference as it showcases their talent.”\nWhile a two-minute clip on social media about their crowd work might work wonders for some, a few feel otherwise. Sahil says, “It is the lowest form of art by a comic. It is borderline derogatory humor at the expense of the audience and involves little to no craft.“\n“Another downside to crowd work is that audiences feel they can heckle the artiste at anytime, given their proximity to the stage. People feel they can say anything without consideration for the comedian,” says Ipsita.\nMore recently, UCC has come up with a new series titled Is It Love? that questions if this basic human emotion is born of convenience or genuine care. “I just talk to the audience and try to understand their idea of love. “Will I find love?” is a question our generation is continuously asking. So, series revolves around that,” says Harman.\nSo whether one is looking for love or a dose of laughter, a comedy club could be worth a shot.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/underground-comedy-club-and-bengalurus-shifting-evening-culture/article68779656.ece", "authors": ["Abhilekh Baruah", "Priyamedha Dutta", "Abhilekh Baruah & Priyamedha Dutta"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T06:16:59", "language": "en", "description": "Many are choosing to spend an evening laughing even as the city’s comedy club culture continues to grow"},{"title": "In pictures: How India is celebrating Christmas 2024", "text": "The star represents the Christmas star that appeared on the night sky over Bethlehem to guide people to baby Jesus.

India celebrated its victory at the ICC T-20 World Cup 2024, 18-year-old D. Gukesh became the youngest World Chess champion, and the country showcased impressive performances at the Paris Olympics.\nHowever, alongside these successes, 2024 also brought several controversies that stirred the nation. Here are the top 5 sporting controversies that deserve attention.\nVinesh Phogat Paris Olympics disqualification\nAce wrestler Vinesh Phogat’s disqualification from the Paris Olympics not only shattered her dream of an Olympic medal but also that of billions around the world. Vinesh Phogat weighed 100 grams more than her wrestling category and thereby was disqualified to play the final.\nAs per reports, Ms. Phogat had shifted from the 53 kg to the 50 kg category in the wrestling and reached the finals by defeating undefeated and defending champion Yui Susaki in the opening round. However, luck wasn’t much in her favour, and she was disqualified on the morning of the final for being 100 gm overweight. Although the Haryana-born wrestler appealed her disqualification in the Court of Arbitration of Sports, the decision stood, and Ms. Phogat’s dream of an Olympic medal was trashed.\nImane Khelif Gender Row\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif won gold at the Paris Olympics, but her triumph was overshadowed by a gender eligibility row. The gender controversy ignited at the Paris Games in August when Khelif defeated Angela Carini in 46 seconds in her opening bout, the Italian reduced to tears and abandoning the fight after suffering a badly hurt nose.\nAll these became the talk of the sporting world and triggered a debate on gender policy at the Olympics. It led to a row that attracted comments from politicians and personalities ranging from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to “Harry Potter” author JK Rowling. Earlier, Khelif was also banned from competing in women’s boxing after failing an unspecified gender test and people pointed that out saying that the Algerian should not be competing in the women’s section.\nKL Rahul and Sanjiv Goenka tiff\nLucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka’s animated discussion with K.L. Rahul after a heavy defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad had become one of the talking points of last season’s IPL. Mr. Goenka’s animated chat, purportedly reprimanding Rahul after Lucknow Super Giants’ record demolition at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad in Hyderabad, had gone viral on social media.\nFollowing this, many prominent figures and sporting personalities came in support of Rahul. TV commentators Graeme Smith and Scott Styris remarked that such discussions should occur privately, not in front of cameras. Mohammed Shami was the first Indian cricketer to criticise the act. “Crores of people are watching you and learning from you. If these things happen in front of cameras, and you see such reactions on screen, it’s shameful,” a blunt Shami said.\nAntim Panghal’s eviction\nDuring the Paris Olympics, Indian wrestler Antim Panghal added more embarrassment for India as she was deported from Paris with immediate effect for a disciplinary breach. when she attempted to help her sister enter the athletes’ village using her accreditation card. As a result, she was called back to India by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).\nBajrang Punia suspension\nThe National Anti-Doping Agency on November 26, 2024, suspended Bajrang Punia for four years for his refusal to provide his sample for a dope test on March 10 during selection trials for the national team. NADA first suspended the Tokyo Games bronze medallist wrestler on April 23, 2024, for the offence, following which the world governing body, UWW, also suspended him. The suspension means that Punia will not be able to return to competitive wrestling and apply for a coaching job abroad, if he aspires to.\nJannik Sinner doping accusations\nAnother shocking controversy that rocked the sports world in 2024 was the doping accusations against top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner. Sinner tested positive in two separate drug tests in March, and the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed the decision to clear him of any wrongdoing in September. A final ruling is expected from the Court of Arbitration for Sport early next year.\nIn the meantime, Sinner explained that the banned performance-enhancing substance entered his system unintentionally through a massage from his physiotherapist, who had used a spray containing the steroid to treat his own cut finger.\nRed Bull’s patience with Sergio Perez\nSpeculation had been growing about Sergio Perez’s future at the Milton Keynes team for a while after a tough season. Despite starting well, the 34-year-old’s performance declined as the season went on.\nChristian Horner confirmed that Mr. Perez decided to leave Red Bull after being with the team for four years. Despite a strong start in 2024, Mr. Perez faced challenges later on, scoring only nine points in the last eight races. His contract, originally set to end in 2026, was terminated early last week, and Liam Lawson will take his place next season.\nAlthough Mr. Perez had signed a two-year contract extension in June, it was later announced that both Perez and Red Bull agreed to part ways immediately after the season ended. Liam Lawson will move up from RB to join Max Verstappen as his teammate in 2025. Perez finished the 2024 season in eighth place in the drivers’ championship, a significant 285 points behind his teammate Verstappen, who won the title. Red Bull also missed out on the constructors’ championship, slipping to third behind McLaren and Ferrari.has context menu.\nCharlotte Dujardin horse-whipping incident\nAnother controversy erupted at the Paris Olympics 2024 when a video of three-time gold medalist Charlotte Dujardin from Britain whipping a horse during training went viral. This whipping scandal has brought the issues of animal welfare and abuse into the spotlight. The FEI (Fédération Equestre Internationale) reviewed photos sent by the animal welfare group PETA, which showed Parro hyper-flexing Safira’s neck in a prohibited movement known as “Rollkur,” which affects the horse’s breathing.\nDujardin received an international ban from the FEI, the governing body for equestrian sports, which is backdated to the start of her provisional suspension. She will be eligible to compete again from July 2025.\nParis Olympics Last Supper’ tableau\nParis Olympics organizers apologised to anyone offended by a tableau inspired by Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper” during the opening ceremony, while also defending the concept behind it. Religious groups worldwide criticised the segment, with the French Catholic Church’s conference of bishops condemning it as “scenes of derision” that mocked Christianity. This sentiment was echoed by Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.\nThe Anglican Communion in Egypt also expressed its “deep regret” on Sunday, stating that the ceremony could lead the IOC to “lose its distinctive sporting identity and its humanitarian message.”\nControversial Qatar goal\nIndia was so close to making history in the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers, but poor refereeing played a significant role in the outcome. Lallianzuala Chhangte’s goal put India ahead, but the controversial decision on Yousef Aymen’s equalizer turned the tide in Qatar’s favour.\nThe subsequent goal by Ahmed Al-Rawi sealed India’s fate despite their strong first-half performance. It’s disappointing when such decisions affect the outcome of a game, especially in such crucial matches.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/sport/sports-controversies-top-10-sports-controversies-of-2024-vinesh-phogat-gender-row-paris-olympics/article69016121.ece", "authors": ["Amrita Narayan"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T05:06:48", "language": "en", "description": "Top 10 sports controversies of 2024: 2024 saw significant sports milestones, controversies, and achievements, including India's T-20 World Cup win and gender eligibility row.

Back then, the school had around 2,000 students, but today, it has just 52 students across seven classrooms.\nAround two years ago, the school building underwent a makeover. The school has smart boards and smart classes equipped with projectors, but not enough teachers to utilise these facilities properly. There are three teachers, each teaching about a dozen subjects to different classes.\n“We have all the facilities we need infrastructure-wise, but we do not have enough human resources to utilise these facilities in the best way possible for our students,” said a teacher at the school.\nThere are 3,222 government schools in Karnataka, most of which are over 100 years old. The majority of such schools are in Belagavi (479), Vijayapura (250), Haveri (223), and Dharwad (202). There are 31 such schools in Bengaluru North, 56 in Bengaluru South, and 68 in Bengaluru Rural.\nIn the last few years, the government of Karnataka has been providing grants of up to ₹16.5 lakh to many such schools for infrastructural development.\n“In the last few years, we have given such grants anywhere between ₹5 lakh to ₹16.5 lakh to 18 schools in Bengaluru, and many more across Karnataka. The schools can utilise this money for anything they need to develop or maintain the school,” Dr. V. Trilokchandra, Commissioner, Department of Public Instruction and Literacy, told The Hindu.\nGrants are released for government schools for their overall maintenance, and schools listed under the School Development Plan (SDP) also receive substantial amounts.\nA teacher at the Karnataka Public School in Basavanagudi said the school was given ₹16 lakh last year. “With that money, we repaired our ceiling and made it waterproof, as it was leaking. As ours is a stone building, we do not face many other infrastructural challenges,” she said. This school has just six teachers, with an option to call in guest teachers when necessary, and it serves 179 students from LKG to class 7.\nDespite these improvements to the infrastructure, many such schools face issues such as teacher shortage, and the fact that student strength has kept dropping over the years. In most such schools, a teacher handles at least three subjects, and 12 to 15 subjects every year.\n“In the last five years, the strength has reduced from around 150 students to 52 students. We started English medium too and publicised it largely during admission seasons. But with the Right to Education Act, many parents now choose to send their children to private schools,” said the teacher in the Government Model School, Malleswaram.\n“We also face the issue of having another government Tamil school, which is functioning in the same building.

Unlike the BBMP, the BDA lacks an online platform for submitting and tracking applications, forcing applicants to rely on a manual system that is both inefficient and time-consuming. Bureaucratic hurdles are common, with applicants required to visit the BDA office multiple times and submit hard copies of documents, leading to unnecessary complications. The system has remained the same for years now,” said Prashanth, an applicant.\nRamesh Kumar J. (name changed), an applicant, said only after paying ₹20,000 to an agent will one get approval from the authority. “According to the agents, they have to pay at least ₹12,000 to the officials for this work. As my approval process was being delayed, I engaged an agent after which I got the green signal in 20 days,” he said.\nCorruption is a major issue, as many officials allegedly demand bribes to expedite approvals. Those who refuse to pay bribes face harassment, additional demands, and prolonged delays. The process is also highly opaque, making it difficult for applicants to track the status of their submissions, a property owner said.\nThe BBMP has implemented an online building approval system, significantly reducing processing times and minimising corruption. Earlier this year, the civic body has also introduced ‘Nambike Nakshe’, on the trust and verify model, where building plans issued by empanelled architects are deemed approved, without any intervention from civic officials. Citizens and urban planners are now urging the BDA to adopt similar reforms to modernise its approval process.\nA senior BDA official said the authority is working towards making the building plan approval process online to bring transparency in the system. “As of now, we have issued strict instructions to officials to approve building plans within 48 hours of the application.

This was done by the Union Law Ministry following a recommendation from the Election Commission (EC). While the EC said the amendment aims to restrict access to electronic data, the Opposition and transparency activists have been up in arms, branding it as an attack on the right to information and electoral freedom.\nWhat is the Conduct of Election Rules?\nThe Conduct of Election Rules,1961, is a set of rules which provide for provisions on how to conduct the elections as per the Representation of People Act.\nWhat is the amendment?\nThis amendment was brought into effect through a notification issued by the Ministry of Law and Justice on December 20. Rule 93(2)(a) of the 1961 Conduct of Election Rules had earlier stated that “all other papers relating to the election shall be open to public inspection” but after the amendment, it reads, “all other papers as specified in these rules relating to the election shall be open to public inspection.”\nWhy has the amendment been brought in now?\nThe move comes after a recent direction to the EC by the Punjab and Haryana High Court to share all documents related to the Haryana Assembly election, including treating CCTV footage also as permissible under Rule 93(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules, to petitioner Mahmoud Pracha.\nAccording to a senior official of the EC, “The rule mentioned election papers. The election papers and documents does not specifically refer to electronic records. In order to remove this ambiguity and considering the serious issue of violation of secrecy of vote and potential misuse of CCTV footage of inside the polling station using artificial intelligence by a single person, the rule has been amended. to safeguard misuse of CCTV footage of inside of the polling station. The EC argues that sharing of CCTV footage may have serious repercussions, especially in sensitive areas like Jammu and Kashmir, naxal-affected regions, etc where secrecy is important. The lives of the voters may also be at risk. All election papers and documents are otherwise available for public inspection.”\n“Candidates in any case have access to all documents, papers and records. Even Mr. Pracha was entitled to all the documents and records from his constituency when he contested as a candidate in Lok Sabha elections 2024”, the official said. adding nothing has been amended in the rules in this regard.\nWhy are the transparency activists protesting?\nRTI activists have termed the move as a setback to transparency.\nAccording to transparency activist Anjali Bharadwaj, Rule 93 is akin to the Right to Information Act as far as elections are concerned and, any change hurts the citizen’s right to know about the process.\nVenkatesh Nayak, Director Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative explained further that “upon initial examination, the amendment appears to be aimed at restricting citizen-voters’ right to access a large number of documents created during Parliamentary and State Assembly elections many of which are not specifically mentioned in the Conduct of Election Rules, instead, they are mentioned in the handbooks and manuals published by the Election Commission from time to time”. Some of these records are reports submitted by Election Observers, scrutiny reports submitted by Returning Officers after polling day and the Index Cards sent to the EC after the declaration of results which contain detailed statistics relating to the elections.\nHe said that given the controversy about voter turnout in recent Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, access to the Presiding Officers’ diaries which contain detailed data about voter turnout at different points of times throughout polling day and the number of tokens they distribute to voters who are in the queue at the hour scheduled for closing of polling are not mentioned specifically in the Conduct of Election Rules. “Yet access to such documents is crucial to assess the fairness of elections. The amendment seeks to prevent access to such documents and many other reports and returns that are filed by various election officials”.\nWhat does the Opposition say?\nThe Congress claimed that a change in rules regarding the conduct of elections vindicated their assertions regarding the rapidly eroding integrity of the electoral process managed by the EC.\nThe Congress moved the Supreme Court against the amendments on Tuesday.\nCongress President Mallikarjun Kharge has said it was part of a “systematic conspiracy to destroy the institutional integrity of the EC”, while the Samajwadi Party and the Left parties accused the EC of “undermining multi-party democracy” by taking “unilateral” decisions without consulting all political parties.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-are-activists-opposing-ecs-election-rule-amendment-explained/article69024277.ece", "authors": ["Sreeparna Chakrabarty"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T03:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Amendment to Conduct of Election Rules sparks controversy over public access to poll documents, raising transparency concerns."},{"title": "Biryani is a ₹10,000-crore market in Tamil Nadu", "text": "The biryani market in Tamil Nadu is a culinary powerhouse, with a staggering valuation at ₹10,000 crore. Those tracking the food business in Tamil Nadu explained that the organised market is pegged at ₹2,500 crore while the unorganised market stands at over ₹7,500 crore. Chennai is the largest market for biryani with 50% of business coming from this region.\nProminent players in the biryani industry in Tamil Nadu, include Dindigul Thalappakatti, Junior Kuppanna, Buhari, Anjappar, Salem RR Biryani, Ponnusamy, and SS Hyderabadi Biryani, among others. In addition to these well-known brands, there is a vast network of mid-sized establishments operating under various names. Furthermore, countless push-cart vendors serve biryani throughout the day and night, contributing to the widespread availability of this popular dish.\n“The primary regions known for biryani in Tamil Nadu are the Kongu region — the Coimbatore belt, as well as the Ambur and Dindigul regions. Some of the famous styles are Chennai Muslim biryani (basmati rice), Kongu biriyani (Seeraga samba rice), Chettinad biryani, Ambur style biryani, Wallajah style biryani and Dindigul style biryani,” explained Balachandar R., executive director, Junior Kuppanna who has done an extensive research on the biryani market in Tamil Nadu. Junior Kuppanna sells around 1.2 million biryanis per year.\nWith 65 outlets across Tamil Nadu, the famous Dindigul Thalappakatti, one of the biggest players in this space sells around 5,000 to 6,000 kg of biryani per day. It’s Managing Director, Sathish D. Nagasamy, said that the numbers vary depending on festival days and weekends. Mr. Nagasamy pointed out that the unorganised market is growing year on year.\nAbdul Rahim, founder of Mount Road Bilal, said: “I’m not a quantity player – I focus more on quality and we cook biryani every two hours and then serve. We don’t make it in the morning and keep it the whole day. We make around 300-400 kg of biryani each day,” he added.\nPrice points for biryani vary widely depending on the establishment and type of meat (chicken, mutton). At roadside shops, a chicken biryani can be priced as low as ₹100 per plate, with a quarter plate available for ₹60. Mutton biryani is typically priced higher due to the cost of the meat. Popular brands offer biryani in the range of ₹250 to ₹400 per plate. Some premium brands sell biryani at ₹600 per plate, while high-end hotels and restaurants charge over ₹1,600 per plate. Those tracking the food business say that despite the pricing, mutton is the clear favourite while chicken is considered a pocket-friendly option.\nTaj Coromandel’s Gilli Biryani, crafted over two decades ago, remains a favourite choice among biryani enthusiasts in Chennai. “Gilli Biryani’s demand is very impressive and high, especially considering its signature status at Taj Coromandel’s Anise in Chennai. On a regular day, we sell approx. 60 to 70 portions, including mutton, chicken and vegetarian options,” said Ronald Menezes, Hotel Manager, Taj Coromandel.\nAccording a report by Swiggy titled, ‘How Chennai Swiggy’d in 2024’, “The city devoured 46.1 lakh Chicken Biryanis! Enough for a biryani mountain. A user laid the foundation of this mountain by ordering 66 of them in one single order.” This statistics is based on data collected from January 01, 2024 to November 22, 2024.\nGiven the growing demand for biryani, start-ups and masala brands are also seizing the opportunity to capitalise on this booming market. Chennai-based start up Cookd is selling about 30k Biryani kits every month, that helps make Biryani for about 1 lakh people every month. “We wanted to build a product that people could use almost every week and in most of the house-holds biryani is a weekend ritual. This influenced us to create our biryani kits,” said Aathitiyan, founder and CEO, Cookd.\nThe founder of a popular masala brand in Tamil Nadu said that he was currently working on introducing five different biryani masala packs in the coming year. “The R&D work is on now,” he added.

This will help sharpen the perception of children, the way they look at anything in life, boost confidence and more,” he said.\n107 schools covered\n“The first level of this project was us training theatre actors and directors with a curriculum that included folk stories, puppetry and music.

The tradition gradually wove into the rich fabric of local life, creating a mosaic of religious and regional celebrations reflecting the country’s diversity. Today, the festival has spread nationwide, turning local markets, churches and shopping malls into glittering wonderlands. Karnataka, where Christianity began to take root around the late medieval period, is not exempt from these celebrations.\nIn Bengaluru and rest of Karnataka, Christmas is truly a celebration that defies Hollywood’s snow-covered fantasies, but rather a tableau of the cultures it hosts.\nHere is what some of the Christians here do to celebrate the festival every year.\nRegional flavour\nIn the rural landscapes of Karnataka’s Bidar district, it is a meticulous celebration that begins on December 1, with a family-wide cleaning ritual that leaves no surface untouched. “Some people will even go the extra step to whitewash the outside of their homes, if not every year, at least every three years,” says Bengaluru-based Meghna Martin, who spends her Christmas with her protestant Kannada Christian extended family in the region every year.\nShe talks about how the season’s true spirit shines through in the community’s embrace, with many families inviting neighbours and colleagues across religious lines to partake of a Christmas feast or dawat. “Most Christians have their celebrations in their own house, so this becomes the perfect opportunity for us to open our doors to non-Christians in our community,” Meghna explains.\nAccording to her, local churches come alive with bhaghanis — Christmas songs performed in distinctive local styles. The air fills with the sweet rhythm of cymbals and dhol, punctuated by systematic clapping. As night falls, young children traverse from house to house, carrying Christmas wishes through their melodious carols, warmly greeted with steaming tea and biscuits.\n“Desserts and Christmas go hand in hand,” Meghna says. Women dedicate entire nights to preparing various delicacies, ensuring there is always plenty to share. While plum cakes make their expected appearance, the real stars are local treats like karjikai and obbattu. “We always make it a point to have extra,” Meghna says. “You cannot leave a house without a box of your own sweets.”\nFrom God’s own country\nIn the Romo-Syrian Catholic churches of Bengaluru, a profound ritual unfolds in the weeks leading to December 25th — the lighting of four symbolic candles, each representing a sacred essence: love, hope, joy, and peace.\nThe churches become living portraits of tradition, with a reimagined nativity scene. Baby Jesus is ceremoniously carried into the church, a symbolic journey that transforms theological narrative into lived experience. “Wine and plum cake are unmissable on the Christmas spread,” says Ashlin Cherian, whose family is from Kottayam. The preparation is an art form in itself. Local vendors are scoured for the finest dried fruits and nuts, which are then soaked in rum. Rose biscuits and kulkuls are crafted with anticipation of arriving children, relatives, and friends.\nYet, the Christmas cake remains the undisputed centrepiece. The Indian plum cake is far from its English variant. The story goes that the warmly spiced plum cake we know today was born out of the meddlings of a British planter in Thalassery and a local baker, the latter experimenting with local ingredients and ratios until the fudgy maroon cake we know today was born, a delectable metaphor for cultural fusion.\nLights and more\nIn the streets of Cox Town in Bengaluru, as the second week of December unfolds, neighbourhoods come alive with the sound of carolling. “Singing and spreading joy is one of the most important parts of Christmas,” says Andrea Benita, a Tamil catholic living in Bengaluru.\nAndrea says that the lighting of the yennai satti, an oil pot, signals the beginning of festive preparations. Soon, kitchens transform into culinary workshops, with the women preparing an array of traditional snacks in odd numbers—7, 11, or 13 varieties, including murukku and adhirasam. “My family also made non-traditional sweets such as the gollsa, a sweet made out of rice flour and eggs,” Andrea recalls. But these delicacies remain untouched, a testament to the season’s sacred anticipation. “My mother would not even taste them while she was making it,” she adds.\nThe creation of the Christmas crib becomes a cherished family ritual. “Come 23rd evening, my father would place the first stool of the crib, as the rest of the family gathered around to complete it,” remembers Andrea.\nChristmas Eve transforms the city, with midnight mass stretching into the early hours of December 25. As prayers conclude, families burst into celebration, children eagerly diving into the month’s carefully prepared snack boxes. But the magic does not end there. People emerge into the night to draw elaborate rangolis or kolams — intricate patterns of swirls and lines that will greet Christmas morning. “All the neighbours will come out of their houses in the middle of the night to draw them in front of their houses,” Andrea narrates.\nIn the Konkan\nCharmaine Ferns, a lawyer with roots in Goa, who splits her time between Bengaluru and Mumbai, succinctly summarises the essence of the season’s spiritual prelude. “You cannot have the birthday celebration without paying your respects to the Birthday Boy,” she says, pointing out that the Roman Catholic traditions of Advent set the stage, with four contemplative Sundays preparing faithful hearts for the grand celebration.\nMidnight mass becomes a pivotal moment, a sacred threshold between anticipation and jubilation. “The mood is lighter after mass,” Ferns describes. “Families exchange sweets, adults settle in with coffee and cakes, while children run off in their own groups.”\nThe Christmas lunch is a picturesque affair that tells a story of the community’s diverse heritage. “You cannot miss the turkey,” Ferns emphasises, as the golden-roasted centrepiece commands attention. But the feast does not stop there.\nKonkani-inspired classics like sorpotel and vindaloo are coupled with more typical spiced wedding pulav and rich chicken curryv—va testament to the blending of Portuguese and Indian cultures. Desserts emerge as the grand finale, including traditional plum cake, nevris, nankhatai, marzipan, date rolls, and guava cheese. “The Christmas desserts end up becoming the reason for New Year’s fitness goals,” Ferns laughs, encapsulating the delightful excess of the season.\nAn inclusive Christmas\nSleepy December mornings ring with the chimes of Christmas carols in Clive Van Buerle’s Bengaluru home. For the governing body member of the All-India Anglo-Indian Association, Christmas embodies the spirit of family and inclusivity. “Anyone and everyone is welcome to join us,” he says.\nCarnivals and food stalls, hosted every weekend leading up to Christmas, create spaces for people from the community to gather over fun fare and tunes. The month-long decorating process is arduous but rewarding. The season of giving maintains its significance, with fundraisers organised to benefit the less privileged.\nThe Christmas preparation begins months in advance, with fruits and nuts soaking in rum until December arrives. “Cake mixing is a cherished family activity,” Van Buerle shares. The treat roster includes traditional cookies, sugar-dusted kulkuls, homemade fudge, and various delicacies. His north Indian wife brings a unique fusion to their celebrations. “Our cakes tend to have more warm spices and tutti frutti — a distinctly Indian mix of colourful candied papaya — mixed into them,” he explains.\nHomemade port wine is a seasonal staple, while Christmas lunch is an intimate yet elaborate affair. Traditionally featuring beef or pork, the pot roast remains an indispensable element of any Anglo-Indian Christmas table. Additionally, Van Buerle’s home boasts a grazing table complete with Christmas treats prepared throughout the month, allowing guests to sample as they socialise. The Indian element in Anglo-Indian cuisine shines through aromatic yellow coconut rice, spicy beef ball curry, and the rather misleadingly named devil chutney. “When surrounded by good food and company, any disagreements harboured over the year fade into the background,” Van Buerle reflects, encompassing the reconciliatory spirit of the season.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengalurus-christmas-is-a-tapestry-of-diverse-traditions-it-is-home-to/article69018555.ece", "authors": ["Aamirah Thayibah"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T02:30:00", "language": "en", "description": "The story of Christmas in the subcontinent traces back to Portuguese explorers who first landed in Fort Kochi, Kerala.

By 2013-2014, exterior grit wash and plaster had fallen from many buildings, exposing cracks in pillars and columns. Interior ceilings also began deteriorating as early as 2012.\nDDA engaged National Council for Cement and Building Materials (NCCBM) and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, which categorically recommended that the buildings in question should be demolished, as the same cannot be repaired.\nOn account of the persistence of the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) and residents of the society, DDA agreed for demolition and reconstruction of the towers and rehabilitation of the petitioners. However, several resident moved the court claiming the rehabilitation offer of DDA was “impracticable”, including entitlement of rent of a willing flat owner who is ready to handover possession, has to wait till every single owner hands over the flat.\nCurrently, 70% of flat owners, i.e. 250 out of 336 flats, have already given their consent to the demolition and reconstruction programme by the DDA.\nThe court, which was dealing with numerous petitions by home owners of Signature View apartment, highlighted that the present cases bring to the fore “shocking facts” regarding the apathy displayed by the DDA in getting residential towers constructed under the DDA Housing Scheme, which started displaying signs of deterioration within a short span of their disposal and occupation by the residents.\n“Such delinquency and gross negligence by the DDA is unpardonable, as the same has put lives of hundreds of residents therein, to great risk and danger,” Justice Pushkarna observed adding, “The present cases accentuate the disregard shown by the DDA of its welfare purposes, for which it was established for the development of Delhi”.\nDDA cannot construct extra flats\nThe court struck down DDA’s plea to construct additional 168 flats on account of the increase in the available Floor Area Ratio (FAR) as per the prevailing norms.\nThe court said noted that the flat owners had purchased the flats by taking into account the original sanctioned layout plan of the housing estate/society with regard to the parking area, community space, common area, green area/open space, natural airflow and sunlight and other basic amenities. “Therefore, the valuable rights of the residents over the common areas cannot be impaired,” it said.\nFacilitation amount\nThe court said DDA shall pay facilitation amount/rent at the rate of Rs 50,000 per month to owners of HIG Flats and Rs 38,000 per month to owner of MIG Flats from the date when the flat has been vacated.

Mr. Biden said converting their punishments to life imprisonment was consistent with the moratorium imposed on federal executions in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.\n“Joe Biden just commuted the Death Sentence on 37 of the worst killers in our Country,” he wrote on his social media site. “When you hear the acts of each, you won’t believe that he did this. Makes no sense. Relatives and friends are further devastated. They can’t believe this is happening!”\nPresidents historically have no involvement in dictating or recommending the punishments that federal prosecutors seek for defendants in criminal cases, though Mr. Trump has long sought more direct control over the Justice Department's operations. The president-elect wrote that he would direct the department to pursue the death penalty “as soon as I am inaugurated,” but was vague on what specific actions he may take and said they would be in cases of “violent rapists, murderers, and monsters.”\nHe highlighted the cases of two men who were on federal death row for slaying a woman and a girl, had admitted to killing more and had their sentences commuted by Mr. Biden.\nOn the campaign trail, Mr. Trump often called for expanding the federal death penalty — including for those who kill police officers, those convicted of drug and human trafficking, and migrants who kill U.S. citizens.\n“Trump has been fairly consistent in wanting to sort of say that he thinks the death penalty is an important tool and he wants to use it,” said Douglas Berman, an expert on sentencing at Ohio State University’s law school. “But whether practically any of that can happen, either under existing law or other laws, is a heavy lift.”\nMr. Berman said Mr. Trump’s statement at this point seems to be just a response to Mr. Biden’s commutation.\n“I’m inclined to think it’s still in sort of more the rhetoric phase. Just, ‘don’t worry. The new sheriff is coming. I like the death penalty,’” he said.\nMost Americans have historically supported the death penalty for people convicted of murder, according to decades of annual polling by Gallup, but support has declined over the past few decades. About half of Americans were in favor in an October poll, while roughly 7 in 10 Americans backed capital punishment for murderers in 2007.\nBefore Mr. Biden's commutation, there were 40 federal death row inmates compared with more than 2,000 who have been sentenced to death by states.\n“The reality is all of these crimes are typically handled by the states,” Mr. Berman said.\nA question is whether the Mr. Trump administration would try to take over some state murder cases, such as those related to drug trafficking or smuggling. He could also attempt to take cases from states that have abolished the death penalty.\nMr. Berman said Mr. Trump's statement, along with some recent actions by states, may present an effort to get the Supreme Court to reconsider a precedent that considers the death penalty disproportionate punishment for rape.\n“That would literally take decades to unfold. It’s not something that is going to happen overnight,” Mr. Berman said.\nBefore one of Mr. Trump's rallies on Aug. 20, his prepared remarks released to the media said he would announce he would ask for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers. But Trump never delivered the line.\nOne of the men Mr. Trump highlighted on Tuesday (December 24, 2024) was ex-Marine Jorge Avila Torrez, who was sentenced to death for killing a sailor in Virginia and later pleaded guilty to the fatal stabbing of an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old girl in a suburban Chicago park several years before.\nThe other man, Thomas Steven Sanders, was sentenced to death for the kidnapping and slaying of a 12-year-old girl in Louisiana, days after shooting the girl's mother in a wildlife park in Arizona. Court records show he admitted to both killings.\nSome families of victims expressed anger with Mr. Biden’s decision, but the president had faced pressure from advocacy groups urging him to make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates. The ACLU and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops were some of the groups that applauded the decision.\nMr. Biden left three federal inmates to face execution. They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history.\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin, Michelle L.

Our nation marks the 100th Jayanti of our beloved former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji. He stands tall as a statesman who continues to inspire countless people.\nOur nation will always be grateful to Atal Ji for being the architect of India’s transition into the 21st century. When he took oath as PM in 1998 our nation had passed through a period of political instability. In about 9 years, we had seen 4 Lok Sabha elections. The people of India were getting impatient and also sceptical about governments being able to deliver. It was Atal Ji who turned this tide by providing stable and effective governance. Coming from humble roots, he realised the struggles of the common citizen and the transformative power of effective governance.\nAlso read | Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a storied career with poetic flourishes\nOne can see the long-term impact of Atal Ji’s leadership in so many sectors around us. His era marked a gigantic leap in the world of Information Technology, telecom and communications. This was particularly important for a nation like ours, which is also blessed with a very dynamic Yuva Shakti. The NDA Government under Atal Ji made the first serious attempt to make technology accessible to the common citizens. At the same time, there was foresight in connecting India. Even today, most people recall the Golden Quadrilateral Project, which connected the length and breadth of India. Equally notable were the Vajpayee Government’s efforts to enhance local connectivity as well through initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Similarly, his Government gave a push to metro connectivity by doing extensive work for the Delhi Metro, which stands out as a world-class infrastructure project. Thus, the Vajpayee Government not only boosted economic growth but also brought distant regions closer, fostering unity and integration.\nWhen it comes to the social sector, an initiative like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan highlights how Atal Ji dreamt of building an India where modern education is accessible to people across the nation, particularly for the poor and marginalised sections. At the same time, his government presided over many economic reforms which set the stage for India’s economic surge after several decades of following an economic philosophy which encouraged cronyism and stagnation.\nA wonderful example of Vajpayee Ji’s leadership can be seen in the summer of 1998. His Government had just assumed office and on 11th May, India conducted the Pokhran tests, known as Operation Shakti. These tests exemplified the prowess of India’s scientific community. The world was stunned that India had done the tests and expressed their anger in no uncertain terms. Any ordinary leader would have buckled, but Atal Ji was made differently. And what happened? India stood firm and resolute with the government calling for another set of tests two days later, on 13th May! If the tests of the 11th showed scientific skill, the ones on 13th showed true leadership. It was a message to the world that gone were the days when India would buckle under threats or pressure. Despite facing international sanctions, the then NDA government of Vajpayee Ji stood firm, articulating India’s right to safeguard its sovereignty while simultaneously being the strongest proponent of world peace.\nAtal Ji understood Indian democracy and also the need to make it stronger. Atal Ji presided over the creation of the NDA, which redefined coalitions in Indian politics. He brought people together and made NDA a force for development, national progress and regional ambitions. His Parliamentary brilliance was seen throughout his political journey. He belonged to a party with a handful of MPs but his words were enough to rattle the might of the all-powerful Congress Party that time. As Prime Minister, he blunted the criticisms of the Opposition with style and substance. His was a career spent largely in the Opposition benches but never carried any trace of bitterness against anyone, even though the Congress stooped to new lows by going to the extent of calling him a traitor!\nHe was also not one to cling on to power through opportunistic means. He preferred to resign in 1996 instead of following the path of horse-trading and dirty politics. In 1999, his Government was defeated by 1 vote. A lot of people told him to challenge the immoral politics happening then but he preferred to go by the rules. Eventually, he came back with another resounding mandate from the people.\nWhen it comes to commitment to protecting our Constitution too, Atal Ji stands tall. He was deeply impacted by the martyrdom of Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Years later, he was a pillar of the anti-Emergency movement. In the run-up to the 1977 elections after the Emergency, he agreed to merger of his own Party (Jan Sangh) into the Janata Party. I am sure it would have been a painful decision for him and the others, but safeguarding the Constitution was all that mattered to him.\nIt is also noteworthy how deeply rooted Atal Ji was in Indian culture. Upon becoming India’s External Affairs Minister, he became the first Indian leader to speak in Hindi at the United Nations. This one gesture showcased his immense pride in India’s heritage and identity, leaving an indelible mark on the global stage.\nAtal Ji’s persona was magnetic and his life was enriched by his love for literature and expression. A prolific writer and poet, he used words to inspire, provoke thought, and even offer solace. His poetry, often reflective of his inner struggles and hopes for the nation, continues to resonate with people across age groups.\nFor so many Bharatiya Janata Party Karyakartas like me, it is our privilege that we were able to learn and interact with a person like Atal Ji. His contribution to the BJP was foundational. In those days to spearhead an alternative narrative to the dominant Congress showed his greatness. Alongside stalwarts like Shri L.K. Advani Ji and Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi Ji he nurtured the party from its formative years, guiding it through challenges, setbacks and triumphs. Whenever the choice came between ideology and power, he always chose the former. He was able to convince the nation that an alternative world view from the Congress was possible and such a world view could deliver.\nOn his 100th Jayanti, let us rededicate ourselves to realising his ideals and fulfilling his vision for India. Let us strive to build an India that embodies his principles of good governance, unity, and progress. Atal Ji’s unwavering belief in the potential of our nation continues to inspire us to aim higher and work harder.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nation-will-always-be-grateful-to-atalji-for-being-the-architect-of-indias-transition-into-the-21st-century-pm-modi/article69024361.ece", "authors": ["Narendra Modi"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T01:01:00", "language": "en", "description": "Celebrating the 100th Jayanti of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a statesman who transformed India with vision and leadership."},{"title": "KCR, Harish Rao get relief as HC suspends lower court’s order allowing revision case against them", "text": "Former Chief Minister K.

As a visual storyteller, I love to capture the colourful scenes and the expressions of kids,” said Shiladitya Chattoraj, an HR professional posted in Bhubaneswar.\nHe added: “Kolkata keeps on evolving. There is a new pattern of illumination on Park Street and the places around are brighter. Many new cafes and restaurants have added spice to the festival and the newly-started street music culture is also very exciting and promising. On the other hand, you see less of trams and yellow taxis — that’s painful.”\nAccording to Ananya Maitra, a senior finance professional based in Mumbai, Kolkata looks brighter than ever this Christmas. The city officially got into the celebratory mode on December 19 when West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee inaugurated the annual Christmas festival on Park Street.\n“Every year the city decks up even more. Earlier the lighting was primarily concentrated in Park Street and Bow Barracks, now we find Christmas lights across the length and breadth of the city. As if this is a winter Diwali. Even in the most unlikely places we find lights lining bridges and roads and pavements,” Ms. Maitra said.\nShe emphasised: “No other place celebrates Christmas like Kolkata. In other cities, it is mostly a religious festival, whereas in Kolkata, Christmas, like other festivals, is a celebration where people across the religions enjoy in abandon.” Her friend Sreelekha Maitra, an advertising professional based also in Mumbai and currently visiting Kolkata, agreed: “I keep coming back every Christmas simply because it’s a city that knows how to celebrate any occasion with spirit and fervour. Festivities happen right on the streets and they include all irrespective of religion. And, of course, there are perennial favourites like Nahoum’s fruit cake, lights of Park Street, the Allen Park carnival, multiple music and cultural fests.”\nFor those living outside Kolkata, the cakes of Nahoum are not only a primary attraction but also synonymous with Christmas celebrations. People standing in the queue at the shop during this time of year is a sight that Susam Ghosh, now living in New Zealand, doesn’t like to miss.\n“Nahoum is a Jewish bakery where Hindus stand in the queue to buy Christmas cakes made by Muslim chefs to celebrate a Christian festival. Calcutta never stops fascinating us, and Christmas here is no exception,” Mr. Ghosh said. “I have been to Champs-Élysées in Paris, to the London Christmas market, and to Sydney, but our own carnival stands out in many ways, something that makes me feel proud as a Kolkatan.”\nTanushyam Chattopadhyay, working at Adani AI Labs in Ahmedabad, also said that he spent Christmas in multiple cities but always missed the thrill he experienced in Kolkata. “When it comes to lighting, Kolkata never differentiates between Diwali and Christmas, and in terms of decoration and vibrance, it does not differentiate between Durga Puja and Christmas.

Among those rescued are 14 children.\nTaking suo motu cognisance of The Hindu report titled, ‘Survivors of bonded labour in Maharashtra: unshackled, yet the scars run deep’ and a couple of other reports on the survivors of bonded labour, the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC) directed the State government to release compensation for the survivors under the Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourer (CSSRBL).\nAll the survivors had been initially paid ₹30,000 each from the State’s bonded labour victim compensation fund.\nAssistant Labour Commissioner Nashik C.N. Birar said this was the first time in the State that a total of ₹86 lakh of final compensation was being released in a single year for 39 survivors of bonded labour from two districts. From Nashik, 25 survivors received a final compensation of ₹44 lakh (19 women and child survivors received ₹2 lakh each and six male survivors got ₹1 lakh each) and 14 survivors (₹3 lakh each) from Ahilya Nagar got a final compensation of ₹42 lakh.\nCounselling under way\n“The ones from Nashik who were rescued from Ahilya Nagar, belong to the Katkari tribe. There were children aged between 13 and 15 among the total 31 survivors. Of them, 25 have received final compensation and six of them are expected to receive ₹11 lakh as final compensation by January 2025. The rescued children have been admitted to schools in their respective villages. With the help of NGOs, they are given counselling to overcome the trauma. They have undergone physical and mental harassment,” said Mr. Birar.\nRevannath Bhisale, Assistant Commissioner of Labour, Ahilya Nagar, said all the hearings at the judicial magistrate court on the issue happened in the last eight months. “Once the Central government releases the fund, it comes to the State government, which then transfers it to the respective District Collectors. From there, the fund is transferred to the respective bank accounts of the survivors. On October 29, 2024, we deposited ₹3 lakh in each (14 survivors) of the survivors’ bank accounts and it was credited the next day. Of these 14 survivors, six are physically and mentally ill. NGOs, labour department, revenue department and the police department worked together to make this happen with constant follow-ups.”\nSiraj Shaikh, administrative officer of the Shree Amrutvahini Gramvikas Mandal, an NGO in Ahilya Nagar that offers shelter to homeless people, said, “It is for the first time in India that the government has issued full compensation to multiple survivors of bonded labour in a year. But we want this to be sustainable and futuristic for them and we wish to make them financially independent so that they do not have to be dependent on the NGO. We are working on a skill-development model that will shape them as an entrepreneur, but it requires a lot of counselling and training because some of them are differently abled, some are extremely traumatised that they have lost speech. We are open to receiving funds to take this forward.”\nThe NGO learnt about the fund being credited to the survivors’ accounts only on December 21, 2024, as the accounts were not linked to any mobile phone as the survivors do not own one nor was KYC (Know Your Customer) verification done.\nCannot withdraw funds\nDilip Gunjal, founder of the NGO, said, “We received the letter from MSHRC only on December 12, 2024, saying the money is credited. I went to check the bank passbooks on December 21. The fund is credited but they will not be able to withdraw money as they need to do KYC. To do KYC, they require documents such as residential proof, voter ID, Aadhaar card and then PAN card (Permanent Account Number). We have approached the District Collector who has promised help with the documentation. From the NGO, we can provide them domicile residential certificate. The bank accounts were created first because the District Collector insisted that the labour department consider it as a special case.”\nFour rehabilitated\nThe NGO has also been able to successfully rehabilitate four survivors from Nandurbar, Pune, Bihar and West Bengal and reunited them with their family.\n“We are constantly following up on their well-being.

Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s constitution states that all citizens in this country have equal rights to eat, live and live freely, but the BJP even questions that.

He was wheeled across the threshold as bells tolled across Rome and the choir inside the basilica began Christmas Eve Mass.\n“The steps we now take are the steps of the whole church,\" the pope said.

Francis has long incorporated prison ministry into his priestly vocation, and has made several visits to Rebibbia and other prisons during his travels.\nSecurity around the Vatican was at its highest levels following the Christmas market attack last week in Germany, the interior ministry said.\nItalian authorities were using extra police patrols and camera surveillance around Rome, while pilgrims faced metal detectors and other security checks to access St. Peter's Square via a reinforced police barricade passage.\nFrancis, who turned 88 last week, went into the Christmas week and Jubilee launch with a cold that forced him to deliver his weekly Sunday blessing from indoors. His health and stamina, already compromised because of his tendency to get bronchitis, are a concern given the rigorous calendar of events during the Holy Year.\nOne of the highlights will be the canonization of the teenage internet whiz Carlo Acutis, considered the first millennial and digital-era saint, during the Jubilee dedicated to adolescents in April.\nThis week, Francis celebrates Christmas Eve Mass on Tuesday evening and then delivers his annual “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) speech on Christmas Day from the loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica.

And the main Jubilee project was finished just in time: A pedestrian piazza linking Castel St. Angelo to the Via della Conciliazione, the main boulevard leading to St. Peter’s Square, was unveiled Monday.\nVatican officials insist that Rome has a tradition of welcoming pilgrims and point to how past Jubilees have left their mark on the Eternal City’s urban and spiritual landscape. The Sistine Chapel was commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475, and the big Vatican garage was built for the 2000 Jubilee under St. John Paul II.\nPope Boniface VII called the first Holy Year in 1300, and in recent times they are generally celebrated every 25 to 50 years.

The list sparked outrage as the monthly payment of ₹1,600 per person is meant for the disadvantaged sections of society.\nA few days later, an audit by the State’s Finance Department revealed that many wealthy people, including owners of high-end cars, in Kottakkal municipality of Malappuram district, had snuck into the list of beneficiaries, presumably with the connivance of government officials.\nThe Finance Department then issued instructions to government departments to initiate disciplinary action against all those who were fraudulently claiming pension and recover the money in full at a penal interest rate of 18%.\nLast week, the State Soil Survey and Soil Conservation Department suspended six employees who were illegally drawing social security pension. More departments are expected to follow suit in the following weeks. The government has also taken steps to weed out ineligible recipients from the list of beneficiaries.\nOver the years, Kerala has been a model State in the distribution of social security pension. The support system ensures that nearly 50 lakh people receive a monthly payment of ₹1,600. The beneficiaries include people who are 60 years or older, the disabled, widows, unmarried women above 50 years, and agriculture labourers.\nThe government increased the pension amount from ₹600 per beneficiary in 2016 to ₹1,600 in 2017. A revised government order issued in 2017 was specific about ineligibility too, stating that income tax payers, service pensioners, and people with an annual family income of more than ₹1 lakh do not qualify for pension.\nAccording to the Economic Review published by the State Planning Board, the number of social security pensioners rose from 34 lakh in 2015-16 to 52.38 lakh in October 2022. It came down to 46.77 lakh in November 2023. If we add welfare fund board pension to this list, the number would be closer to 62 lakh.\nThe latest Economic Review breaks up the categories as follows: 56.5% of the beneficiaries are those aged 60 years and above, 27.1% are widows, 7.8% are the disabled, and 6.8% are agricultural workers. A little more than 81,300 unmarried women are also among the recipients. Those who have been illegally drawing pension have been mostly doing so under the disability and widow category.\nThese figures illustrate the enormous financial load on the Kerala government. The government needs more than ₹900 crore every month to pay social security and welfare fund board pension. Social security cesses on Indian-Made Foreign Liquor, petrol, and diesel, announced in the 2023-24 State Budget, scarcely cover even one month’s payment. The first two quarters of 2024-25 yielded just ₹549.71 crore from these levies. According to Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal’s office, the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front government, which came to power in 2021, has so far spent ₹33,800 crore on social security pension alone. The State government also claims that a Central share, albeit small, for which 5.88 lakh of the pensioners are eligible, is in arrears.\nAll this means that the Kerala government, which is already battling a financial crunch, cannot overlook any leakage and pilferage in public funds. A January 2020 Finance Department circular indicates that the government was aware that government employees and service pensioners were illegally drawing social security support. The circular instructed them to return the money in full and get their names deleted from the beneficiary list. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India had also flagged the issue of ‘irregular disbursement’ of pensions to service pensioners and employees in a performance audit report for 2022.\nThe latest developments yet again call for tighter surveillance on the outflow and utilisation of funds for social support schemes as well as periodic reviews and updates of the lists of beneficiaries. Further, action must be taken against government servants who were complicit in this.\ntiki.rajwi@thehindu.co.in", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/pocketing-pension-meant-for-the-poor/article69022525.ece", "authors": ["Tiki Rajwi"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T20:59:56", "language": "en", "description": "The outflow of funds for social support schemes needs to be monitored closely"},{"title": "Bethlehem marks a second subdued Christmas during the war in Gaza", "text": "Bethlehem marked another somber Christmas Eve on Tuesday (December 24, 2024) in the traditional birthplace of Jesus under the shadow of war in Gaza.\nThe excitement and cheer that typically descends on the West Bank during Christmas week were nowhere to be found. The festive lights and giant tree that normally decorate Manger Square were missing, as were the throngs of foreign tourists that usually fill the square.\nPalestinian scouts marched silently through the streets, a departure from their usual raucous brass marching band. Some carried a sign that read, “We want life, not death.” Security forces, meanwhile, arranged barriers near the Church of the Nativity, built atop the spot where Jesus is believed to have been born.\n\"Always the message of Bethlehem is a message of peace and hope,\" said Mayor Anton Salman. “And these days, we are also sending our message to the world: peace and hope, but insisting that the world must work to end our suffering as Palestinian people.”\nThe cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town's economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income — almost all of it from the Christmas season. Salman said unemployment is hovering around 50% — higher than the 30% unemployment across the rest of the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Finance Ministry.\nLatin Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the top Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, noted the shuttered shops and empty streets and expressed hope that next year would be better. Pizzaballa held a special pre-Christmas Mass in Holy Family Church in Gaza City on Sunday.\n“This has to be the last Christmas that is so sad,” he told hundreds of people gathered in Manger Square, where normally tens of thousands would congregate. “I bring you the greetings, the prayers, of our brothers and sisters in Gaza.”\nThe number of visitors to the town plunged from a pre-COVID high of around 2 million per year in 2019 to fewer than 100,000 in 2024, said Jiries Qumsiyeh, the spokesperson for the Palestinian Tourism Ministry.\nBethlehem is an important center in the history of Christianity, but Christians make up only a small percentage of the roughly 14 million people spread across the Holy Land. There are about 182,000 in Israel, 50,000 in the West Bank and Jerusalem and 1,300 in Gaza, according to the U.S. State Department.\nAfter nightfall, the golden walls of the Church of the Nativity were illuminated as a few dozen people quietly milled about. A young boy stood holding a pile of balloons for sale, but gave up because there were no customers to buy them.\nThe war in Gaza has deterred tourists and has prompted a surge of violence in the West Bank, with more than 800 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire and dozens of Israelis killed in militant attacks. Palestinian officials do not provide a breakdown of how many of the deceased are civilians and how many are fighters.\nSince the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that sparked the war, access to and from Bethlehem and other towns in the West Bank has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass through Israeli military checkpoints. The restrictions have prevented some 150,000 Palestinians from leaving the territory to work in Israel, causing the economy there to contract by 25%.\nIn the Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 250 Israeli hostages. Israeli officials believe that around 100 hostages remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip.\nElsewhere, Christmas celebrations were also subdued.\nScores of Syrian Christians protested Tuesday in Damascus, demanding protection after the burning of a Christmas tree in Hama the day before.\nVideos and images shared on social media showed the large, decorated tree burning at a roundabout in Suqalabiyah, a town in the Hama countryside. It remains unclear who was responsible for setting the tree on fire.\nIn a video that circulated on social media, a representative of Syria’s new leadership, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, could be seen visiting the site and addressing the community. He said: “This act was committed by people who are not Syrian, and they will be punished beyond your expectations.”\nGerman celebrations were darkened by a car attack on a Christmas market on Friday that left five people dead and 200 people injured.\nPresident Frank-Walter Steinmeier rewrote his annual recorded Christmas Day speech to address the attack.\nHe plans to acknowledge that “there is grief, pain, horror and incomprehension over what took place in Magdeburg,” while urging Germans to “stand together,” according to an early copy of the speech.\nA snowstorm in the Balkans stranded drivers and downed power lines, but some saw the beauty in it. “I’m actually glad its falling, especially because of Christmas,” said Mirsad Jasarevic in Zenica, Bosnia. “We did not have snow for Christmas for 17 years here, and now is the time for wonderful white Christmas.”\nAmerican Airlines briefly grounded flights across the U.S. on Tuesday due to a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive.

In Chennai, the stretch from Tiruvottiyur to Kasimedu Harbour requires attention. Chengalpattu needs reformation at Olive Beach, Devaneri, and Mamallapuram. In Mayiladuthurai, stretches at Tharangampadi and Pombuhar are affected. In Nagapattinam, reformation is needed at Akkaraipettai and Velankanni. Ramanathapuram requires action at Mookaiyur, and in Thoothukudi, Vembar, Tiruchendur, and Manappad are stretches needing attention. Kanniyakumari has several affected areas, including Mel Midalam, Enayamputhen-thurai, Erayumanthurai, Edappadu, Vallavilai, and Marthandamthurai. In Puducherry, Kottakuppam to Kurichikuppam and Pondy Marina need reformation.\nThe analysis was done as part of the Shoreline Management Plan (SMP), mandated by the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2011. The notification requires States to create a Coastal Zone Management Plan that includes the classification of CRZ categories, an assessment of shoreline changes, the SMP, and a coastal land use map that highlights fish breeding grounds, turtle nesting sites, and areas used by coastal communities, among others.\nThe SMP, prepared by the NCCR, involved a month-long survey of the coast by multiple teams on foot. Several factors were considered for a comprehensive shoreline assessment, including the coastal geomorphology, the presence of river inlets, eco-sensitive areas, and the socio-economic conditions of coastal populations. Additionally, the analysis incorporated data on coastal structures, met-ocean parameters such as wind, tide, wave conditions, and sediment budgeting. The SMP includes an action plan designed to address immediate and long-term needs for coastal protection. An overview of the SMP was presented at a capacity building workshop organised by the Department of Environment for officials from Chennai, Chengalpattu, and Tiruvallur. The NCCR’s SMP outlines strategies to address coastal erosion, while also considering the sustainable development of the coastline.\nNearly 13.5% of Tamil Nadu’s coastline is occupied by artificial structures. These, besides river regulation and sea-level rise, contribute to coastal erosion and accretion. Moreover, Kanniyakumari and Tiruvallur stand out for having the highest concentration of coastal structures. While the former mostly has coastal protection structures, the latter is home to more coastal infrastructure developments. These distinctions are important in tailoring effective strategies for each region.\nRahul Nadh, Member Secretary, Tamil Nadu State Coastal Zone Management Authority, said the SMP was pending approval from the Government of India and was expected to be published for public comments, along with the Coastal Zone Management Plan and the coastal land use maps, in January 2025.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-coast-has-69-erosional-zones-20-sites-in-need-of-reformation/article69023775.ece", "authors": ["Geetha Srimathi"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T18:55:12", "language": "en", "description": "Shoreline analysis by NCCR identifies erosion-prone areas along Tamil Nadu coast, highlighting the need for reformation and protection measures."},{"title": "Meat shop owner hacked to death by employee", "text": "Refusal to lend ₹20,000 proved fatal for a 45-year-old meat shop owner as he was hacked to death by his employee at his house in Begur on Monday, over the dispute.\nThe deceased Ali Afsar had lent ₹3 lakh to his employee identified as Akbar for over one year but he did not repay.

They feared it would lead to more dropouts and children getting into labour market.\nOn the other hand, some private school managements and students’ groups have welcomed the government’s decision.\nWhat the changed rules say\nThe Ministry of Education, in its gazette notification dated on December 16, titled ‘Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Rules, 2024’, states that if a child fails to fulfil promotion criteria in Classes 5 or 8 in the regular examination, they can be held back.\nIt also emphasised the need for remedial measures for such students to close learning gaps. They will get an opportunity for re-examination within two months from the date of declaration of results.

Section-16 of the Act prohibited holding back or expulsion of a child from school till the attainment of elementary education. The changes in the act brought out now, he said, were a “deliberate attempt to dilute and distort the historic Act.” He urged that the State government reject the detention proposal. “The Chief Minister should take the lead in this,” he said.\n“Repeating a class does not give the child any special resources to deal with the same syllabus requirements for yet another year. Parents and friends of such children also tend to view them as failures,” he added.

The route winds through the Buckingham Canal and the Pallikaranai Marsh. The project was completed from Beach to Velachery in 2007, when Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi inaugurated the services. Since then, the MRTS has built a commuter base.\nThe MRTS was designed to have elevated tracks, with the ground floor meant for commercial purposes. It was believed that rents from the commercialisation of the space would help to create a sustainable transport facility for Southern Railway and pave the way for the expansion of the project. Nearly two decades have passed since the services were launched first till Thirumayilai, then till Thiruvanmiyur, and finally till Velachery. But the huge space available at the stations on prime locations remains vacant and poses a security threat to the commuters.\nProject report ready\nInitially, the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) planned to execute the commercial project. Now, the Tamil Nadu government’s Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) has prepared a detailed project report for creating a special purpose vehicle, to be handled by the Chennai Metro Rail Limited, for taking over the MRTS from Southern Railway. The proposal is pending with the Railway Ministry.\nMeanwhile, the Chennai Division of Southern Railway itself is exploring the possibility of using the vacant space for commercial purposes. A senior official says that as the proposal to hand over the MRTS to the State government is pending with the Railway Board, it has been planned to commercially exploit the vast unused space at the 15 MRTS stations.\nThe MRTS line runs from Beach to Velachery, a vital route for commuters. The vacant space presents a unique opportunity for commercial ventures such as retail outlets, food establishments, convenience stores, service centres, co-working spaces, warehousing and stacking facilities, and boarding houses, the official adds.\nOpen to all\nThe Expression of Interest (EoI) has been invited for developing the vacant space at the 15 stations as commercial hubs to increase the market value of the stations. The EoI is open to individuals, non- governmental organisations (NGOs), charitable institutions, corporations, business entities, and other interested parties, says the official. Railway officials will identify vacant areas, assess market possibilities, study the feasibility of commercial use, identify potential business opportunities and investors, calculate the cost, and address the potential issues for creating the business base.\nThe Railways will help to get permission from government departments for establishing such commercial establishments. The official says a comprehensive business plan for each station, based on the infrastructure available and the infrastructure proposed, is being prepared. A total of 36,500 square metres of space at these stations has been identified for commercial exploitation.\nThe 15 stations are Chintadripet, Chepauk, Thiruvallikeni, Light House, Mundakakanni Amman Temple, Tirumayilai, Mandaveli, Greenways Road, Kotturpuram, Kasturibai Nagar, Indira Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur, Taramani, Perungudi, and Velachery. Except at the Velachery station, where 500 square metres has already been allotted, in the other stations 2,000 square metres each has been identified for commercial utilisation.\nDriven by kiosks and canteens\nThe plan comes after Southern Railway made a good revenue by allotting a huge parcel of vacant land outside the Velachery station to a multi-cuisine food court named Karnival.

Turkish-backed armed groups alongside Turkish jets for years have attacked positions where the SDF are largely present across northern Syria, in a bid to create a buffer zone free from the group along the large shared border.\nWhile the SNA was involved in the lightning insurgency — led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — that toppled Mr. Assad, it has continued its push against the SDF, seen as Syria’s second key actor for its political future.\nOn Monday (December 23, 2024), the SDF spokesperson Farhad Shami said the group's forces pushed back the Turkish-backed rebels from areas near the Tishrin Dam on the Euphrates, a key source of hydroelectric power. He said the SDF also destroyed a tank belonging to the rebels southeast of Manbij.\nThe British-based war monitor said on Tuesday (December 24, 2024) that the Kurdish-led group, following overnight fighting, has reclaimed four villages in the areas near the strategic dam.\nTurkish jets also pounded the strategic border town of Kobani in recent days.\nDuring Syria’s uprising-turned-conflict, the Kurds carved out an enclave of autonomous rule across northeastern Syria, never fully allying entirely with Assad in Damascus nor the rebels trying to overthrow him.\nEven with the Assad family out of the picture, it appears that Ankara’s position won’t change, with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan’s landmark visit to Syria maintaining a strong position on the Kurdish-led group in his meeting with de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa of HTS.\n“It has turned the region into a cauldron of terror with PKK members and far-left groups who have come from Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Europe,\" Mr. Fidan said in a news conference after the meeting. “The international community is turning a blind eye to this lawlessness because of the wardenship it provides (against IS).”\nWith the ongoing fighting, SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi has expressed concern about a strong IS resurgence due to the power vacuum in Syria and the ongoing fighting, which has left the Kurdish-led group unable to carry out its attacks and raids on the extremist group’s scattered sleeper cells.\nTens of thousands of children, family members, and supporters of IS militants are still held in large detention centers in northeastern Syria, in areas under SDF control.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kurdish-led-forces-push-back-turkish-backed-syrian-rebels-in-a-tense-offensive/article69023659.ece", "authors": [], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T17:35:58", "language": "en", "description": "Kurdish-led SDF launches counter-offensive against Ankara-backed SNA near Syria's border, intensifying clashes post-Assad era."},{"title": "Christmas spirit found in social initiatives", "text": "Some organisations and educational institutions in Bengaluru have embraced the spirit of Christmas through social activities this festive season, from building toilets to donating warm clothes to people in need.\nThe SCEAD Foundation is on a mission to build 48 toilets for the tribal residents of Maddur Colony in Chamarajanagar district. “So far, we have constructed 10 toilets, with 38 more expected to be completed by the end of January.

It is because during this time her stall gets a makeover, glowing brighter with colours of rangoli and kolam powders. “The rangoli powder will always be in stock at my shop, but the demand soars during Margazhi. We sell each box for ₹20,” says Ms. Ammu.\nSteady business\nShe says the demand for the kolam colours has never waned, and year after year, the customers come steady. “A regular customer bought rangoli powders for ₹500,” she says, beaming. As she chats, more customers stream in, stacking their bags with boxes of the season’s must-have colours.\n“People from all over Chennai flock to Mylapore for the colours because there is usually a spot where there is a box of every shade possible,” Ms. Ammu says. “And it is not just locals. We see visitors from abroad curious about kolam powders and the rangoli colours,” she adds.\nA row of shops along the Mada Streets is brimming with hues and shades of kolam powders, a staple of the Margazhi season. On the corner of North Mada Street is R. Devi with her family; they juggle everything, from stringing flowers to selling sugar cane and small diyas throughout the year. But when it is December, the family mainly sells kolam powders, bringing large sacks from various markets in and around Chennai.\nMany tasks\n“I am usually up at 3 a.m., heading to the Koyambedu market for buying fresh flowers. After selling the flowers, I am already setting up kolam powders by noon,” says Devi, expertly scooping powder into smaller boxes from the sack.\nShe is adept at putting up these different small stalls one after the other with the changing seasons. This has not only helped to build a loyal customer base but has also funded her children’s education.\n“My daughters and son are in good schools and colleges because of my working day and night,” she says.\nHer daughter, R. Sangeetha, who graduated recently with a degree in economics, pitches in while job-hunting. “My mother has been at this very spot for decades, like my grandmother.

I still have vivid memories of my first walk — on Mylapore’s musical heritage. That was put together with the guidance of the great painter, musicologist, singer, and one of the early heroes of Tamil cinema — S. Rajam. My dear friend and top-ranking singer Sanjay Subrahmanyan helped and encouraged in every way and was present at the event. S. Muthiah gave his blessings, remarking that it was a first for the city.\nI have, in some years, managed to conduct a walk each month, but that has not always been possible. I still dream of completing and charting 100 different routes in the city, and having done 80-odd so far, I believe the goal is well within sight. However, I do find that the core city has become increasingly walking-unfriendly, and as for the suburbs, while they are my area of focus now, heritage spots there are too few and far apart to be covered on foot. However, I am still hopeful.\nIn the initial years, projecting one’s voice to a group, above the general din and chaos, was a challenge, but then technology of late has been a big boon, though it can be a bane too — the most recent tour of mine, at the Kapaliswarar Temple, almost came a cropper as the Wi-Fi microphone failed, as did the standby. But some quick thinking by my wife saved the situation.\nBut enough on me and my experiences. What I want to write about is my joy at the way in which heritage walks have caught on in the city. There are many others who have done so — Pradeep Chakravarthy and Sudha Umashankar in the initial years, Chithra Madhavan, Vincent DeSouza, and Padmapriya Bhaskaran who do special themed walks on occasion, Madras Inherited which does architecture-themed walks on a regular basis, and of course, Story Trails which is available on demand. And how can I forget Chennai Photo Walks? I may have omitted some others for which I may be forgiven. But of late it is Srivatsan Sankaran and Tripurasundari Sevvel who have caught my attention.\nApart from being a brilliant photographer, Srivatsan works on making heritage accessible to persons with disabilities. He speaks boldly on his being hearing-challenged, and has conducted heritage walks with sign language. He has also conducted photo walks for people with such issues, especially children. Tripurasundari has been a collaborator and when she is not busy in her profession as an architect and the live wire at the Madras Literary Society, is working on making heritage accessible to those with visual, speech, and hearing impairment, and also school children. She has worked with The Hindu on many such projects and also more importantly with the Greater Chennai Corporation. I hope the civic body will listen to her and make our city heritage walk-friendly.\nTripurasundari’s latest project is really innovative. During COVID-19, she came up with the idea of getting rubber stamp engravers to make moulds of heritage buildings. When she conducts walks at the relevant places, she gets these stamped on postcards and has the participating children mail them to friends and family! A post box is brought to lend verisimilitude. This December, I got her to make a rubber stamp on the Music Academy and picture postcards of the building with the sketch by Afreen Fathima, another heritage enthusiast. I plan to send them out to music-loving friends at the end of the music season.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/heritage-walks-in-chennai-then-and-now/article69022296.ece", "authors": ["Sriram V"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T17:27:42", "language": "en", "description": "Celebrating 25 years of heritage walks in Chennai, V.

Karunanidhi, introduced a clause to the Tamil Nadu Temple Entry Authorisation Act, known as the Temple Entry Act, to allow persons who are not Hindus to visit temples. According to the new rule, non-Hindus should be admitted to temples only when puja was not performed. They were permitted to enter the Mahamandapam and not the Ardhamandapam. The non-Hindus were required to inform temple authorities of the object of their visit, obtain a pass, and enter the temple with a temple guide. If there was no guide, a servant of the temple could accompany them. They were to abide by the customs of the temples and safeguard and honour their general and special sanctity. Such persons could not take photographs of any part without the permission of the appropriate authority.\nBar on certain classes\nBefore the rule was introduced, certain classes of persons were not allowed to enter or offer worship at a temple or bathe in or use the waters of a sacred tank, well, spring, or watercourse appurtenant to the temple, whether situated in or outside the precincts thereof, or any sacred place, including a hill or hillock, road, street, or pathway requisite for obtaining access to the temple. They included persons who were not Hindus, “persons under pollution arising out of birth or death in their families; women at such times during which they are not by custom and usage allowed to enter a temple; drunken or disorderly persons; persons suffering from any loathsome or contagious disease; persons of unsound mind except when taken for worship under proper control and with the permission of the executive authority of the temple concerned; and ‘professional’ beggars”.\nKalyan Dass, a permanent resident of Tulasi Babu Mutt at Rameswaram, moved the Madras High Court against the introduction of the impugned Rule 4-A. He argued that the Rule violated Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution and was discriminatory, too, as the mode and manner of worship at Hindu temples were all matters of religion guaranteed by the Constitution. Besides, he contended, the Rule enabling non-Hindus to enter temples not for worship but for other purposes did not further the object or purpose of the Temple Entry Act.\n‘Sanctity not affected’\nThe government, however, argued that at several temples, the trustees allowed non-Hindus, such as foreigners, to go round the Vimanam every day without objection from anybody. There was nothing either in the Constitution or in the accepted practice or the Agamas which could prevent the rule-making authority under the Temple Entry Act to make the impugned rule. It submitted that the sanctity of the temples was in no way affected by allowing non-Hindus into certain parts thereof.\nJustice T. Ramaprasada Rao, who heard the case, however, said courts and even legislation could not convert temples into archaic objects of visual importance intended for public exhibition. It was well-known that there could be no such thing as an unregulated and unrestricted right of entry to a public temple or other religious institution for persons not connected with the spiritual functions thereof.\nThe judge noted that earlier, the legislature, to respect the policy of the government to avoid discrimination among Hindus, tried to remove the disability of certain classes of Hindus to enter temples. But this statutory benefit was always intended to confer a privilege on “certain classes of Hindus” and not on non-Hindus. It was nobody’s case that non-Hindus ever had a right to enter Hindu temples not for worship but for sight-seeing and as tourists, he said.\nBeyond the powers\nThe court held that a non-Hindu was not a Hindu. “He belongs to a different class. He cannot, on mundane and social considerations, claim the same privilege or right as a Hindu regarding entry into a Hindu temple. The Legislature also cannot, in exercise of its rule-making power, treat the non-Hindu in the abstract as a Hindu, by ignoring the policy and intendment of the Temple Entry Act.” Consequently, in July 1972, the judge ruled, “I am of the view that Rule 4-A is ultra vires of the powers of the rule-making authority”, and struck it down.", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/when-madras-hc-struck-down-a-rule-that-allowed-non-hindus-to-enter-temples/article69022528.ece", "authors": ["D.

But this seemed like a day for woollens, hot coffee, a book and deep thoughts.\nThe officials, though, kept their fingers crossed. Being a day-and-night fixture, the light was never an issue even if the rain was, and the customary inspection kept happening. In the press box, an administrator dryly said: “The only update is that there is no update.” A scribe quipped: “That perhaps is the best diplomatic line in a while.” Laughter rippled and the wait stretched.\nThe rain teased and tormented, lapsing into a mild drizzle and then gaining vigour and drenching those, who stepped out for some fresh air.
