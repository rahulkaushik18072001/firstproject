{"title": "Delhi Departments Red-Flag Schemes Announced By Arvind Kejriwal, He Reacts", "text": "New Delhi:\nIn dramatic developments amid the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) campaign for Delhi Assembly polls, the capital's Health and Family Welfare department has red-flagged the ruling AAP's registration drive for Sanjeevani Yojana, a scheme to provide free treatment to Delhi's residents aged over 60 at private and government hospitals. Also, the Women and Child Development department has disowned the Mahila Samman Yojana which promises Rs 2,100 per month to women in the capital.\nIn a public notice published in newspapers, the health department has said that it does not have \"any such supposed Sanjeevani scheme in existence\". It added that it had not authorised anyone to collect personal data from elderly citizens and is not providing any card.\nThis comes after AAP leaders, including Chief Minister Atishi and party convener Arvind Kejriwal, visited several areas and launched doorstep registration for Sanjeevani Yojana and Mahila Samman Yojana. The AAP has also come out with an Artificial Intelligence ad with Arvind Kejriwal in a Santa Claus avatar.\nThe department said any individual or political party collecting such forms under the name of this scheme is \"fraudulent and without any authority\".\n\"If a person/entity calls you or visits you with the promise to provide benefit of free treatment under this supposed non-existent scheme or provide you some \"Health/Sanjeevani Scheme Card in this regard, then you are hereby advised to: (1) not believe in any promise of free treatment under the supposed non-existent \"Sanjeevani scheme\" (2) not to provide any personal detail to anybody claiming to provide benefits under the scheme (3) not to affix your signature or thumbprint on any document unknowingly.\"\nThe department has said it will not be responsible for any liabilities or frauds arising out of such \"unscrupulous activities\".\nThe Women and Child Development department said in a notice that no scheme called Mahila Samman Yojana has been notified.\n\"As, if and when such a scheme is notified, the Department of Women and Child Development (WCD), GNCTD, will launch a digital portal for eligible individuals to submit their applications online as per the approved guidelines. The eligibility conditions and modalities will be clearly notified by the department as and when it happens. It is emphasized that since no such scheme exists, the question of physical forms / applications for the registration under this non-existent scheme does not arise,\" it said, adding that any individual collecting forms or information in the name of this scheme is \"fraudulent and without any authority\". The department has warned that sharing personal information in the public domain may lead to people falling prey to cybercrime.\nShortly after the notices were issued, Mr Kejriwal targeted the BJP-led central government. \"The Mahila Samman Yojana and Sanjeevani Yojana have rattled them. Within the next few days, they plan to arrest Atishi ji in a fake case. Before that, senior AAP leaders would be raided,\" he posted on X.\nAccording to AAP sources, 1.5 lakh people have been registered for the Sanjeevani scheme so far and 13 lakh women for Mahila Samman Yojana. A team of 3,000 AAP workers are carrying out the doorstep registrations with a target of 5 lakh registrations daily, the sources said.\nThe departments' notices play out against the backdrop of the power tussle between Delhi's elected government and the Centre. The principal secretaries of all Delhi departments report to the Chief Secretary, a central government appointee. This, in effect, means that the AAP government has no control over Delhi officers, an issue it has repeatedly raised in its 10-year rule in the national capital.\nThe Supreme Court ruled last year that the Delhi government would control the services in the capital, but the Centre brought an ordinance and then an Act to overturn this. This Act established National Capital Civil Services Authority, comprising the Chief Minister, Delhi Chief Secretary and Principal Home Secretary. This Authority makes recommendations to Delhi's Lieutenant Governor on officials' transfers and postings and disciplinary matters. The Chief Secretary and Principal Home Secretary are the Centre's appointees and can easily outvote the Chief Minister.", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/delhi-election-delhi-health-department-red-flags-sanjeevani-scheme-arvind-kejriwal-reacts-7326976", "authors": ["Saikat Kumar Bose"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "In dramatic developments amid the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) campaign for Delhi Assembly polls, the capital's Health and Family Welfare department has red-flagged the ruling AAP's registration drive for Sanjeevani Yojana"}
{"title": "Australia Name Playing XI For Boxing Day Test Against India, Make 2 Huge Changes", "text": "Australia announced their playing XI for the Boxing Day Test match against India starting Thursday and the hosts made two massive changes to their side. Scott Boland made his way into the playing XI in place of the injured Josh Hazlewood while teenage opener Sam Konstas replaced Nathan McSweeney. Kontas is all set to become Australia's youngest Test debutant since skipper Pat Cummins took the field against South Africa at Johannesburg back in 2011. In another major boost, Travis Head was declared fit.\nAggressive number five Head is the highest run scorer in the five-match series, plundering centuries at both Adelaide and Brisbane.\nHe picked up a minor thigh strain at the Gabba and there were lingering concerns about his fitness, but skipper Pat Cummins said the left-hander was fine.\n\"Trav is good to go, so he will play. He just ticked off some final things today and yesterday,\" said Cummins. \"No stress, no worries about injury for Trav, so he will go into the game fully fit.\n\"I don't think you'll see too much management of him through the game. Maybe around fielding if he's a bit uncomfortable, but he's fully fit,\" he added.\nHead has slammed 409 runs at an average of 81.80 across the first three Tests, dominating India as other Australian batters have struggled from the threat posed by pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah.\n\"It feels like the last 12 months he's been in this unbelievable vein of form and he just keeps going,\" Cummins said of Head.\n\"He's hitting the ball really cleanly and you can see the pressure he shifts back onto the opposition, literally from the first ball he walks out there.\n\"I'm loving that he is in our team. Long may it continue.\"\nThe five-match series is tied at 1-1 after India won by 295 runs in Perth before being crushed by 10 wickets at Adelaide.

{"title": "\"I Am MVP Of My Cricket, Not Rohit Sharma Or Virat Kohli\": Ravichandran Ashwin", "text": "Ever since India all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin announced his sudden retirement from international cricket, tributes have been pouring in from all corners for the veteran cricketer. However, Ashwin doesn't want people to celebrate his career or worship him. For him, the sport is above all individuals. However, the owner of 537 Test wickets said that he does want to burst a few cricketing myths. Former England captains Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain had a detailed virtual conversation with Ashwin, who is currently in Chennai following his retirement from international cricket.\nDuring the interaction, Ashwin gave some interesting insights into his memoir \"I Have The Streets: A Kutty Cricket Story\" which was released earlier this year in July. During the chat, Ashwin opened up on one of the biggest myths about him. He said that people think that he is too serious and doesn't enjoy the game as much as someone like Virat Kohli.\nHowever, Ashwin's insisted that's not the case, adding that he gets lost while playing cricket.\n\"I wanted people to know me for who I am, because a lot of times, Ashwin's picking up a wicket and Virat Kohli is all over the place. He's just jumping about and people very often tend to believe that Ashwin's the one that's absolutely serious and Virat's the one that's having all the fun, which is why somebody asked me the question, why are you serious all the time? My answer to that in the first place is I'm never a serious person, but when somebody is clobbering me and I have the ball in my hand to win a Test Match for my country, my mind is sticking, because I'm in the process. So very often, you don't see me picking up a five-wicket haul and pushing across a kiss through the blade of my bat to my better half sitting in the dressing room or sitting in the hospitality box. So I felt like a lot of who I am got diluted in the fact of what I've become. So I wanted to bring that out in my book,\" Ashwin said on Sky Sports.\nIndian cricket has been blessed to witness greats of the game like Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, who often get worshipped like gods.However, Ashwin feels it's harsh to sideline others as cricket is a team sport. But, for Ashwin, he has always been the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of his own story.\n\"A lot of people talk about, when they talk about Indian cricket, that's one thing I want to change over the years. They talk about Virat Kohli, they have been talking about Rohit over the years. When I grew up, I spoke a lot about Sachin, I spoke about other superstars, the celebrities. One message I would leave for everybody and I want to constantly change is that it's not the fact that these are glorious cricketers but people on the outside who believe that everyone plays a support cast are extremely wrong because this is a sport. An MVP in my life, for my dad or for my mom, I am the MVP. It's not Rohit, Virat or somebody on the outside, likewise, everyone's journey is unique. For me, I have always been the MVP and I am the MVP of my cricket,\" he added.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/i-am-mvp-of-my-cricket-not-rohit-sharma-or-virat-kohli-ravichandran-ashwin-7320637", "authors": ["NDTV Sports Desk"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Ravichandran Ashwin doesn't want people to celebrate his career or worship him."}

Kambli was struggled with health issues in the recent past and he was taken to the hospital by a fan. Medical examinations revealed clots in his brain but latest updates suggested that he was doing better. Kambli, who played 17 Tests and 104 ODIs for India between 1993-2000, recently attended the inauguration of legendary coach Ramakant Achrekar's memorial at the Shivaji Park. During the event, he met Sachin and both of them shared an emotional moment.\n\"I am feeling better now...I will never leave this (cricket) because I remember the number of centuries and double centuries I have hit...We are three left-handers in the family. I am thankful to Sachin Tendulkar as his blessings have always been with me...,\" Kambli told ANI.\nAfter a series of examinations the medical team supervising him at Akruti Hospital in Thane found clots in his brain, Dr. Vivek Trivedi informed. Kambli's health is being constantly monitored and the team will carry out additional medical examinations on Tuesday, the doctor said.\nTrivedi also said hospital in-charge S Singh has decided to provide life-long free treatment to Kambli at his medical facility.\nEarlier, Kambli also opened up on his health struggles. The 52-year-old is doing 'better' but suffered a health scare about a month back.\nKambli revealed that he is battling a urine infection, but his wife and kids stood with him like a rock and helped him get back on his feet. He added that former India all-rounder Ajay Jadeja came to see him.\n\"I am better now. My wife takes care of me a lot. She took me to 3 different hospitals and told me 'You have to get fit'. Ajay Jadeja also came to visit me. It felt nice. I was suffering from a urine problem. It was just flowing. My son, Jesus Cristiano, picked me up and brought me back to my feet. My daughter, who is 10 years old, and my wife came to help me. This happened one month ago. My head started spinning; I collapsed and fell down. The doctor told me to get admitted,\" Kambli told Vickey Lalwani on YouTube.\n(With agency inputs)", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/thankful-to-sachin-tendulkar-vinod-kamblis-big-message-after-urgent-hospitalisation-7320897", "authors": ["NDTV Sports Desk"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Vinod Kambli said that he was thankful to childhood friend Sachin Tendulkar for his blessings after the former had to be admitted to a hospital following a deterioration in his health."}

Kambli (52) is responding to the treatment for urinary tract infections for which he was admitted at Akruti Hospital near Bhiwandi town on Saturday (December 21), Dr Vivek Trivedi told PTI. Trivedi is heading the medical team that is supervising the former cricketer's health. Doctors were planning to do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) on the former India batter, but since he has developed a fever, a decision on the non-invasive medical procedure will be taken later, he said. The MRI procedure has been necessitated after a series of medical examinations conducted earlier revealed clots in his brain, Trivedi said.\nKambli is likely to be shifted out of the ICU within a day or two and discharged after about four days, he said.\nHe said the condition of the Mumbai-based former cricketer was critical four days back when he had an extreme urinary infection as puss had got collected in his bladder. The puss was removed when he was admitted to the hospital.\nRemaining at home for some more days would have complicated his condition, Trivedi opined, adding his blood pressure was also fluctuating when he was brought to the hospital.\nHis condition was stable at present, the doctor added.\n\"His condition will be closely monitored for the next 24 hours and a decision taken on shifting him out of the ICU,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and the Shrikant Shinde Foundation, run by his MP-son, have stepped forward to assist Kambli.\nOn the instructions of Eknath Shinde, his Officer on Special Duty (OSD) Mangesh Chiwte visited the hospital to enquire about the former cricketer's health condition, said an official release issued by the deputy CM's office in Thane on Tuesday night.\nChiwte also engaged with the hospital's medical staff to ensure Kambli receives the best possible care during his treatment.\nKalyan Lok Sabha MP Shrikant Shinde, the son of Eknath Shinde, announced a financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh for Kambli.

The attacks, which took place on the night of December 24, reportedly targeted seven villages, including Laman, where five members of a family were killed.\nLocal sources claim that Pakistani jets were responsible for the bombings. Reports indicate that the Murg Bazaar village in Barmal was destroyed, exacerbating the ongoing humanitarian crisis.\nThe airstrikes have caused severe civilian casualties and widespread destruction, further escalating tensions in the region. As recovery efforts continue, further investigation is required to confirm details and clarify responsibility for the attacks, reported Khaama Press.\nThe Taliban's Ministry of Defence has vowed to retaliate following the airstrike on Barmal, Paktika.\nThe Ministry stated that defending their land and sovereignty is their legitimate right, and condemned the attack, claiming that \"Waziristani refugees\" were among those targeted.\nWhile Pakistani officials have not officially confirmed the airstrike, security sources close to the military suggested that the attack was aimed at Taliban hideouts near the border.\nThis comes amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly regarding the presence of Pakistani militants in Afghanistan.\nThe Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), has increased its attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months, with Pakistan accusing the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to them.\nEnayatullah Khwarazmi, a spokesperson for the Taliban Ministry of Defence, denied the Pakistani claims and posted on X (formerly Twitter) that \"civilian people, mostly Waziristani refugees,\" had been killed in the airstrike.\nKhwarazmi added that \"several children and other civilians were martyred and wounded\" in the attack, though no official casualty figures were provided. Sources reported that at least 15 bodies, including women and children, have been recovered, and the death count is expected to rise as search efforts continue.\nThe Waziristani refugees are civilians who had been displaced by military operations in Pakistan's tribal areas. However, Pakistan maintains that many TTP commanders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, where they are reportedly being protected by the Afghan Taliban in border provinces.\nTensions between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban have been building for some time, fuelled by the ongoing presence of TTP members in Afghanistan.

During a phone conversation with US National Security Advisor (NSA) Jake Sullivan, Bangladesh's interim government chief Muhammad Yunus expressed commitment to protect human rights in the troubled South Asian nation.\n\"Both leaders expressed their commitment to respecting and protecting the human rights of all people, regardless of religion,\" the White House said in a statement about the call between Mr Sullivan and Mr Yunus.\nThe call comes less than a month before the Biden administration is set to pass on the power to Donald Trump, who would be sworn in as the 47th President of the United States on January 20 next year. It also came at the backdrop of attacks on Bangladesh's Hindu minority and their places of worship.\nMr Sullivan during the call thanked Yunus for his leadership of Bangladesh during a challenging period, the White House said.\n\"Sullivan re-iterated the United States' support for a prosperous, stable, and democratic Bangladesh, and offered the United States' continued support in meeting the challenges Bangladesh faces,\" said the readout of the call.\nOutrage Of Killing of Hindus In Bangladesh\nThere have been a spate of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, as well as attacks on temples in Bangladesh after the fall of the Hasina government.\nOn December 13, the White House said that President Joe Biden is closely monitoring the situation in Bangladesh and the US will hold the country's interim government accountable for ensuring the protection of religious and ethnic minorities.\nThe conversation between Mr Sullivan and Mr Yunus comes days after Indian American Democratic Congressman Shri Thanedar urged the White House to strongly raise the issue of the killing of Hindus and destruction of their temples in Bangladesh with the head of the country's interim government.\n\"The United States has a storied history of championing the oppressed and this issue should be no different.

{"title": "Indian Cinema 2024: The Ten Best Films Of The Year", "text": "New Delhi:\nThe year was dominated by Pushpa 2, Kalki 2898 AD and The Greatest of All Time, besides a couple of Bollywood horror comedies (Stree 2 and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3), but 2024 saw independent Indian cinema scale a few new highs and produce an array of gems with the power to stand the test of time. The ten best of the year's releases (theatrical and on OTT) were:\nAll We Imagine as Light\nA beautifully crafted film that lights up the screen in hues that linger long after one is done watching it, All We Imagine as Light is an exquisite piece of cinema that draws its strength from the inimitability of director Payal Kapadia's gaze, which incorporates poetry, social commentary and portraiture of a city that nurtures dreams of a better life and yet suppresses the very desires that stem from the urge for individual freedom. At the film's heart are three women, two Malayali nurses working in Mumbai (Kani Kusruti and Divya Prabha) and a hospital cook (Chhaya Kadam), a migrant from Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district trying to save her chawl from a builder. The city gives them space and the anonymity to lead their lives the way they wish but the personal, social and economic hurdles they face never lets them find a steady foothold. The universal acclaim that All We Imagine as Light has garnered is, without an iota of doubt, fully deserved.\nWhere to watch: Running in select multiplexes\nVaazhai\nThe semi-autobiographical film, written, directed and co-produced by Mari Selvaraj, is marked by phenomenal craftsmanship. Behind the artful perfection is a heart and a voice that communicate with as much force as precision. The Tamil socio-political drama views rural poverty and exploitation through the innocent eyes of an aggrieved boy. Set in the late 1990s in a landscape of exceptional natural beauty, Vaazhai plays out in a deprived community whose principal occupation is harvesting raw bananas and loading them on to transport trucks. The hardy people of this southern Tamil Nadu village are at the mercy of brokers and traders. The film reiterates the concerns articulated in Selvaraj's first two films, Pariyerum Perumal and Karnan, but it has a distinct texture and tone that instantly draw the audience in irrespective of how unacquainted they might be with this world.\nWhere to watch: Disney+Hotstar\nMaharaja\nThe odd one out on this 'best of the year' list by virtue of being a high-grossing genre movie, writer-director Nithilan Saminathan's sophomore venture, Maharaja, is a sharply written and executed action thriller brimming with twists and turns that straddle space and time in startling ways. No Indian film in 2024 kept the audience guessing the way Maharaja did from beginning to end. Playing out in two time-zones 15 years apart - 2009 and the present - the double-vengeance drama pits Vijay Sethupathi's titular unassuming barber against Anurag Kashyap's hardened criminal whose paths cross quite by chance in a nondescript hair-cutting salon. Peopled by corrupt cops, a police informer, smarmy gangsters, families caught unawares and a propitious dustbin, Maharaja weaves a complex chain of events, both intended and accidental, into a strikingly coherent, consistently gripping story of individuals grappling with unsettling happenstance. It is all held together magnificently by a superlative pivotal performance from Vijay Sethupathi.\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nUllozhukku\nNational Award-winning filmmaker Christo Tomy's narrative feature debut, Ullozhukku (Undercurrent), is a terrific delineation of a fraught relationship between a woman (Urvashi) and her daughter-in-law (Parvathy Thiruvoth) set against the background of a flood-affected area of Kerala's Alappuzha. The Malayalam film is centred on the two women's conflicting responses to a man on his deathbed, an extramarital affair, a pregnancy and a funeral. The gender dynamic in Ullozhukku is marvellously nuanced and quietly intense as the two women from two different generations navigate the elements that make up the environment they inhabit and the notions of morality that society prescribes for them. The subtlety of the social and personal drama is brought out with great skill by the director. With two actors perfectly in synch with the demands of the plot, the film thrives on the authenticity of the landscape and the delicate emotions it broaches.\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video\nManikbabur Megh\nDebutant director Abhinandan Banerjee's Manikbabur Megh (The Cloud and the Man) is a linear narrative that steadfastly eschews wordiness and melodrama. But that isn't the only reason why it is that rare contemporary Bengali film that dares to strike out in a new direction. Manikbabur Megh, driven by a unique and highly original vision, is anchored by a brilliantly muted performance from Chandan Sen. It employs evocative means to blend gentle flights of surrealism with a deep awareness of the harsh realities of a big city, especially for those that are condemned to languish on its margins or thereabouts, in dispiriting loneliness. The wonderfully well composed essay hinges on a middle-aged schoolteacher trapped in a limbo that makes him incapable of connecting with people around him. With the lead actor masterfully intertwining physical gestures with facial expressions, the film dissects the correlation between urban angst and the emotional vacuums it engenders.\nWhere to watch: Theatrically released, not available for streaming yet\nGirls Will Be Girls\nDebutante Shuchi Talati's Girls Will Be Girls is a consummately constructed coming-of-age story set in a co-educational boarding school in the foothills of the Himalayas. It blends subtle suggestion of tensions between a mother and a daughter and overt yet tentative assertions of tremulous teen sexuality to piece together an unfailingly convincing portrait of a girl who traverses an arc of discovery that brings her face to face with dimensions of her physical, emotional and psychological needs. With a mellow lead performance from debutante Preeti Panigrahi supported by a memorable, emotionally complex turn by Kani Kusruti as the mother, Girls Will Be Girls, which dropped on a streamer late in the year after winning a couple of awards in Sundance in early 2024, deservedly shot to the top of the list of the most sublime young adult dramas ever made in India.\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video\nI Want to Talk\nDirector Shoojit Sircar has a way of squeezing relatable drama out of the minutiae of human life and death. In I Want to Talk, he does just that while dealing with the spectre of mortality and things that it makes the living do. Abhishek Bachchan is a career-best performance as a brash, successful California-based adman laid low by laryngeal cancer, brings to life a battle for survival inspired by a real-life survivor. I Want to Talk evokes the tics of dramas about terminally ill patients but goes beyond the genre's confines to deliver a profoundly moving tale examining the spirit of a man who is told that his days are numbered and who goes under the knife innumerable times. The film touches an instant chord because it is achingly life-affirming. The protagonist, adopting the stance of a fighter, stares down death. I Want to Talk speaks to the innate human urge to conquer the inevitability of transience.\nWhere to watch: Screened in multiplexes. OTT release awaited\nKottukkaali\nP.S. Vinothraj (Rotterdam Tiger Prize winner Koozhangal, 2021) returned in 2024 with a film that is nearly as effective as his unforgettable debut. Kottukkaali (The Adamant Girl), which premiered in the Forum section of the Berlin Film Festival, probes the consequences of patriarchy and superstition on a village girl determined not to kowtow to norms laid down by society. Vinothraj seamlessly merges the absurdist and the naturalistic, helped along by actors who inform their performances with piercing honesty and commitment. The adamant girl of the title (Anna Ben) is believed to be under an evil spell because she stalls the desire of her maternal uncle (Soori) to marry her. The family sets out on a journey to meet a seer who they believe can exorcise the spirit that has possessed the girl. Kottukkaali is a road movie of sorts that makes its way through a maze of mishaps and revelations. It is intriguing and illuminating in equal parts, a genuine cinematic triumph.\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video\nMeiyazhagan\nA bewitching drama centred on two grown-up men negotiating a connection that one of them makes instinctively and the other struggles to fathom, Meiyazhagan, written and directed by C. Prem Kumar, is unusual in more ways than one. The Tamil film enters delicate territory where human emotions swivel around memories of time gone by and look for relevance more than two decades later. Buoyed by two outstanding performances from Karthi and Arvind Swamy, Meiyazhagan - the title comes from the name of one of the two principal characters but it isn't verbalised until very last scene - is a celebration of the little joys of life and the centrality of one's roots in the development of what one holds dear or discards in the inexorable journey of life. In an era of hyper-masculine action films that projects men as vengeance-seeking agents of wrath, Meiyazhagan is a whiff of fresh air, a film that is akin to a warm snuggle on a winter night.\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nFairy Folk\nLow-budget, improvisational filmmaking at its most adventurous (and deliciously unhinged), Karan Gour's Fairy Folk is an exploration of modern-day urban relationships couched in magic-realist fantasy. The film wears its independence on its sleeves and frees the leads, real-life couple Rasika Dugal and Mukul Chadda, to foray into uncharted zones as actors. Situating the man-woman relationship within a disintegrating marriage, the script, written by the director himself, flies in surprising directions with a suppleness that would be difficult to replicate in cinema that plays by the rules. The plot hinges on a couple who runs into a 'creature' on a secluded road in Mumbai (a deserted space in a bustling megalopolis is no less a rarity than the disorienting experiences that lie in wait for the duo). The unmoving, genderless being puts the couple's already strained relationship to the test and lends the film its remarkable uniqueness. Fairy Folk did not get the audience it deserved and that was the latter's loss.", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/indian-cinema-2024-the-ten-best-films-of-the-year-7321981", "authors": ["Saibal Chatterjee"], "date_publish": "2024-12-06T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "From All We Imagine as Light to Maharaja - here's NDTV's top picks for you"}
{"title": "As Google Faces A Grave And Uncertain Future, Apple Steps In. Here's Why", "text": "Washington DC:\nTwo of the world's largest tech behemoths - Apple and Google - are participating together in what is increasingly seeming like an indefensible case. Billions and billions are at stake and Google, the world's 'default' search engine, stares into the abyss.\nThere is much to lose for both tech giants - for Apple it could lead to losses worth tens of billions of dollars per year and an incomprehensible fallout on the accuracy of its results on features like Siri and Spotlight, whose framework is largely dependent on Google search. For Google, besides money and market share, it may result in the massive loss of its entire web browser - Chrome. It also faces another potential gigantic loss - its Android operating system.\nAnd so, finding Google in a major spot of bother, Apple has sought to participate in the anti-trust trial against Google over its internet search engine. Apple on Tuesday said it needs to step in as it cannot rely on Google alone to defend the revenue-sharing agreements that the two firms have.\nThe epicenter of the case, which has sent tremors across Silicon Valley, lies in an agreement between Google and Apple, wherein the iPhone, iPad, and Macbook maker gets tens of billions of dollars each year for making Google the default search engine on its browser - Safari. In 2022 alone, Apple reportedly received in excess of $20 billion as a result of this very agreement.\nThe question at the heart of the case is simple - Has Google monopolised online search? According to Google - No, it has not.\nA monopoly in simple business terms is a situation where a single company controls the entire market. In such a scenario it becomes difficult or sometimes impossible for the competition to compete due to the lack of a level-playing field.\nFocusing on this very point, Apple's lawyers submitted their papers to the court on Tuesday, in which they conveyed that Apple and Google are not competitors, and neither does Apple want to compete in the search engine space. It also said that that is how it will be whether or not Apple receives the billions of dollars from Google in future.\nApple, in its petition, also said it wants to call witnesses who will testify under oath at the trial scheduled for April 2025. On that day, the prosecutors will aim to highlight that Google absolutely must take multiple measures - two of them being selling its Chrome browser and possibly its Android operating system too. The prosecutors believe that only then will competition be restored in online search. But should this happen, it will be a fatal blow to Google.\nWhile Google's parent firm Alphabet is figuring a way to battle this grave threat to its existence, Apple, which understand the gravity of the situation has said \"Google can no longer adequately represent Apple's interests. Google must now defend against a broad effort to break up its business units.\"\nMeanwhile, justifying its stand, Google has asserted that the entire premise of the case is based on exclusive deals - and that is what the focus of the case should be on, instead of an aim to breaking Google. It has even offered to put an end to such deals in future.\nBesides ending the deal with Apple, Google has even suggested that it is willing to no longer enter any agreement with Android phone manufacturers which require the phone-maker to set Google as the default search engine in return for its operating system and supporting apps. Google also said that browser companies like Mozilla would be given more flexibility in setting rival search engines as its default search. This, according to Google's lawyers, is a fair solution to make the market more competitive.\nBetween now and the crucial hearing in April, Google is doing all it can to defend itself and limit its losses, should it lose the groundbreaking case.", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/as-google-faces-a-grave-and-uncertain-future-apple-steps-in-heres-why-7324986", "authors": ["Abhishek Chakraborty"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Two of the world's largest tech behemoths - Apple and Google - are coming together in what is increasingly seeming like an indefensible case.

{"title": "\"Stands Tall As A Statesman\": PM Modi Remembers Atal Bihari Vajpayee", "text": "Atal Bihari Vajpayee stands tall as a statesman and continues to inspire countless people, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote today, paying tribute to the former Prime Minister on his birth centenary.\n\"Our nation will always be grateful to Atal Ji for being the architect of India's transition into the 21st century. When he took oath as PM in 1998 our nation had passed through a period of political instability. In about 9 years, we had seen 4 Lok Sabha elections. The people of India were getting impatient and also sceptical about governments being able to deliver. It was Atal Ji who turned this tide by providing stable and effective governance. Coming from humble roots, he realised the struggles of the common citizen and the transformative power of effective governance,\" the Prime Minister wrote.\nPrime Minister Modi said the Vajpayee era marked a gigantic leap for the Information Technology, telecom and communications sectors. \"This was particularly important for a nation like ours, which is also blessed with a very dynamic Yuva Shakti. The NDA Government under Atal Ji made the first serious attempt to make technology accessible to the common citizens. At the same time, there was foresight in connecting India. Even today, most people recall the Golden Quadrilateral Project, which connected the length and breadth of India. Equally notable were the Vajpayee Government's efforts to enhance local connectivity as well through initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Similarly, his Government gave a push to metro connectivity by doing extensive work for the Delhi Metro, which stands out as a world-class infrastructure project.\n\"Thus, the Vajpayee Government not only boosted economic growth but also brought distant regions closer, fostering unity and integration,\" the Prime Minister wrote.\n\"When it comes to the social sector, an initiative like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan highlights how Atal Ji dreamt of building an India where modern education is accessible to people across the nation, particularly for the poor and marginalised sections. At the same time, his government presided over many economic reforms which set the stage for India's economic surge after several decades of following an economic philosophy which encouraged cronyism and stagnation,\" he added.\nPrime Minister Modi then went on to underline Mr Vajpayee's leadership when India conducted nuclear tests in Pokhran. \"A wonderful example of Vajpayee Ji's leadership can be seen in the summer of 1998. His Government had just assumed office and on 11th May, India conducted the Pokhran tests, known as Operation Shakti. These tests exemplified the prowess of India's scientific community. The world was stunned that India had done the tests and expressed their anger in no uncertain terms. Any ordinary leader would have buckled, but Atal Ji was made differently. And what happened? India stood firm and resolute with the government calling for another set of tests two days later, on 13th May! If the tests of the 11th showed scientific skill, the ones on 13th showed true leadership.\"\n\"It was a message to the world that gone were the days when India would buckle under threats or pressure. Despite facing international sanctions, the then NDA government of Vajpayee Ji stood firm, articulating India's right to safeguard its sovereignty while simultaneously being the strongest proponent of world peace,\" Prime Minister Modi wrote about his senior in the BJP.\n\"Atal Ji understood Indian democracy and also the need to make it stronger. Atal Ji presided over the creation of the NDA, which redefined coalitions in Indian politics. He brought people together and made NDA a force for development, national progress and regional ambitions. His Parliamentary brilliance was seen throughout his political journey. He belonged to a party with a handful of MPs but his words were enough to rattle the might of the all-powerful Congress Party that time. As Prime Minister, he blunted the criticisms of the Opposition with style and substance. His was a career spent largely in the Opposition benches but never carried any trace of bitterness against anyone, even though the Congress stooped to new lows by going to the extent of calling him a traitor!\" the Prime Minister wrote.\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee, he wrote, was not one to cling on to power through opportunistic means. \"He preferred to resign in 1996 instead of following the path of horse-trading and dirty politics. In 1999, his Government was defeated by 1 vote. A lot of people told him to challenge the immoral politics happening then but he preferred to go by the rules. Eventually, he came back with another resounding mandate from the people,\" Prime Minister Modi wrote.\nThe Prime Minister elaborated how Mr Vajpayee agreed to merge his party -- then Jan Sangh -- with the Janata Party to challenge the Indira Gandhi government after the Emergency.\n\"When it comes to commitment to protecting our Constitution too, Atal Ji stands tall. He was deeply impacted by the martyrdom of Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Years later, he was a pillar of the anti-Emergency movement. In the run-up to the 1977 elections after the Emergency, he agreed to merger of his own Party (Jan Sangh) into the Janata Party. I am sure it would have been a painful decision for him and the others, but safeguarding the Constitution was all that mattered to him,\" he wrote.\n\"It is also noteworthy how deeply rooted Atal Ji was in Indian culture. Upon becoming India's External Affairs Minister, he became the first Indian leader to speak in Hindi at the United Nations. This one gesture showcased his immense pride in India's heritage and identity, leaving an indelible mark on the global stage.\n\"Atal Ji's persona was magnetic and his life was enriched by his love for literature and expression. A prolific writer and poet, he used words to inspire, provoke thought, and even offer solace. His poetry, often reflective of his inner struggles and hopes for the nation, continues to resonate with people across age groups,\" the Prime Minister wrote.\nPrime Minister Modi said it was a privilege for BJP workers like him to be able to learn from the stalwart. \"For so many Bharatiya Janata Party Karyakartas like me, it is our privilege that we were able to learn and interact with a person like Atal Ji. His contribution to the BJP was foundational. In those days to spearhead an alternative narrative to the dominant Congress showed his greatness. Alongside stalwarts like Shri LK Advani Ji and Dr Murli Manohar Joshi Ji he nurtured the party from its formative years, guiding it through challenges, setbacks and triumphs. Whenever the choice came between ideology and power, he always chose the former. He was able to convince the nation that an alternative world view from the Congress was possible and such a worldview could deliver.\"\n\"On his 100th Jayanti, let us rededicate ourselves to realising his ideals and fulfilling his vision for India. Let us strive to build an India that embodies his principles of good governance, unity, and progress. Atal Ji's unwavering belief in the potential of our nation continues to inspire us to aim higher and work harder,\" the Prime Minister wrote.", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/stands-tall-as-a-statesman-pm-narendra-modi-remembers-atal-bihari-vajpayee-7326674", "authors": ["NDTV News Desk"], "date_publish": "2024-12-01T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Atal Bihari Vajpayee stands tall as a statesman and continues to inspire countless people, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote today, paying tribute to the former Prime Minister on his birth centenary."}

{"title": "Engaged At 2, Married At 16: Childhoods 'Chained' In Madhya Pradesh Village", "text": "Bhopal:\nIn the heart of Madhya Pradesh, nestled amid the rugged terrains of Rajgarh district, lies Jaitpura - a village where time seems to have stopped, leaving dreams in shackles and childhoods stolen. Here, innocence is traded, and the cruel weight of tradition drags children into adulthood long before their time.\nOur journey began where the road ended, over narrow, broken paths that echoed the hardship of lives untouched by development.\nIn these forgotten corners of India, we found children whose laughter has been silenced by customs like child marriage and engagement, bound by the age-old practice of Jhagda-Natra.\nThis grim tradition demands exorbitant amounts from families seeking to break free from pre-arranged marriages, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and despair.\nThe stories of Jaitpura are a reflection of a broader malaise plaguing 50 villages, where over 700 children have lost their right to a carefree childhood.\nRama Bai, now 40, recalls how her childhood ended abruptly three decades ago.\n\"I got married at the age of 10 years... Every day, girls here are married off. This must stop,\" she said, her voice heavy with the weight of her past.\nGeeta, just 22, carries her young daughter in her arms. Engaged at two, married at 16, she refuses to let history repeat itself. \"I will not engage my daughter. This must end with me,\" she asserts, her resolve a tiny ray of light amid the darkness that lies heavy over the lives of the children.\nOne parent explained the harsh reality: \"Here relationships are often fixed even before birth. When a woman is six months pregnant, families decide-'if you have a boy and we have a girl, they will be engaged.' They stick to their word. As children grow, more money is required, and sometimes, in a drunken state, engagements are finalised. This happened in our family too,\" she said, a tone of resignation in her voice.\nChildhood Dreams in Chains\nThese decisions impact children profoundly, robbing them of their innocence and dreams. Some are as young as one year old when they are engaged, marked with bracelets or lockets to signify the commitment.\nDinesh, a young boy, shared a bittersweet moment about his fiancee: \"My fiancee is frim Gangapar. She was given a bracelet and a pendent during the engagement.\"\nAnother child, Mangilal's fiancée, said: \"I was just a year old when I got engaged. I don't remember much, but I know his name is Mangilal. I didn't receive anything during the engagement.\"\nFor many, these symbols of commitment are not cherished but burdensome.\nA boy, just 10 years old, was vocal about his discomfort. \"I was given sweets when I got engaged, but I didn't want to. I've decided-I won't marry. I'm in the 5th standard, and I want to become a doctor,\" he said.\nFor the young girls, anklets and bangles are not adornments but symbols of oppression. The pain, both physical and emotional, weighs heavily on them.\n\"My feet hurt a lot because of the anklets. I tell my parents every day, but they say I must wear them. This is bondage. I want freedom from these,\" a girl said.\nFor most, these ornaments represent a lifelong burden.\nA 10-year-old, married when she was far younger, said: \"The bangles were put on me during my engagement and marriage. They're said to enhance a girl's beauty, but to me, they are shackles. Sometimes, when there is trouble at my in-laws' house, these bangles are removed and sold.\"\nVillagers justify the system as a compulsion - a way to escape debt, or wedding expenses. But it is the children who pay the price, their lives reduced to mere transactions.\nGovardhan Tanwar, the deputy sarpanch, sounded matter of fact. \"Engagements happen when parents are drunk. They take loans, marry off their daughters, and the cycle continues.\"\nAccording to the National Family Health Survey-5, 46 per cent of women aged 20-24 in Rajgarh were married before they turned 18. Education remains a distant dream, with over half the women in the district illiterate.\nBreaking these shackles comes at a cost. Families must pay hefty fines to annul pre-arranged marriages, often appearing before social panchayats.\nThe price of freedom is crushing, leaving many resigned to their fates. In certain regions of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, if a girl dares to break free from this bondage or refuses to go through with a prearranged marriage, she and her family are summoned before social councils. These councils impose fines, known as 'jhagda' (penalty), for canceling the marriage. In some cases, practices like nata or natara, involving widows or abandoned women returning to society, are also intertwined with these traditions.", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/childhoods-chained-dreams-sold-in-forgotten-corner-of-madhya-pradesh-7324938", "authors": ["Anurag Dwary"], "date_publish": "2024-12-07T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "In the heart of Madhya Pradesh, nestled amid the rugged terrains of Rajgarh district, lies Jaitpura - a village where time seems to have stopped, leaving dreams in shackles and childhoods stolen."}

{"title": "Opinion | Why Nitish Kumar Has Gone 'Silent' Again", "text": "The Bihar unit of BJP has been in a damage control mode to circumvent any misunderstandings over leadership issues with coalition partner JDU (Janata Dal United) before the all-important assembly elections in 2025. On December 22, state BJP leader and deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary categorically stated that the forthcoming Bihar polls will be fought with Chief Minister and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar as the NDA's face.\nRejecting speculation, Choudhary said, \"The NDA is working under the leadership of Nitish Kumar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Bihar and we will continue to contest elections under the leadership of both leaders.\" He went on, \"In 2020, we contested after announcing (Kumar as the NDA's chief ministerial face) and, to date, we have considered Chief Minister Nitish Kumar only (as the NDA leader in Bihar). In future also, we will contest elections under the leadership of Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi.\"\nThe clarification was significant and necessary, given the confusion in political circles - and doubts for its ally JD(U) - that BJP could pull a Maharashtra in Bihar.\nNitish Kumar In A Sulk?\nThe rumour mill went into overdrive after Union Home Minister Amit Shah's recent interview to a news channel. Replying to a question about whether the NDA would go into the Bihar polls without naming a chief ministerial candidate (a strategy that paid off in Maharashtra), Shah had replied, after a pause, \"We will sit together and decide. We will let you know after we have made a decision.\" His reply set tongues wagging about Nitish Kumar's future.\nAdopting an \"all is well\" posturing, JDU officially interpreted Shah's statement as a form of tacit approval for Nitish Kumar's continued leadership. One of its spokespersons said, \"Maun lakshanam, swikriti lakshanam (Silence means tacit consent)\" but called for coordination among NDA allies.\nHowever, sources say there is disquiet among JDU leaders, including Nitish himself.\nLike always, as he does when he is unhappy with coalition partners, Nitish called in sick and didn't attend the two-day \"Global Investors Summit - Bihar Business Connect 2024\"; his two deputies from the BJP, Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha, showed up. The Chief Minister was expected to address potential investors and share the state's economic vision.\nA sulking Nitish Kumar also cancelled his visit to Nalanda district on December 20 to inaugurate a statue of Magadh emperor Jarasandha in Rajgir, along with his two deputies.\nSanjay Kumar, a Patna-based political expert, says during this time the RJD (Rashtriya Janata Dal) sensed an opportunity. \"Nitish went silent. He distanced himself from scheduled programmes. RJD sensed it and made moves to contact Nitish. BJP came to know of these developments and went on damage control mode stating that they will fight elections under Nitish's leadership.\"\nThe Maharashtra analogy looms, because just like in Bihar, the BJP was the senior partner in the ruling coalition.\nTo reassure Nitish Kumar after Shah's interview, NDA constituents in Bihar held a meeting in Patna on December 20 and reiterated their faith in his leadership for the polls, ruling out any reconsideration.\nBihar BJP chief Dilip Jaiswal too sought to explain that key decisions are taken by the parliamentary Board. Other NDA partners like Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) also lent their support to Nitish Kumar.\nAs Nitish Kumar stayed glum, Samrat Choudhary reasserted that his boss would be the NDA's leader for the 2025 polls. Especially as rumours suggested the BJP may fight elections with Choudhary as its chief ministerial face in Bihar.\nBehind the scenes\nA beaming and visibly healthy Nitish Kumar launched his 'Pragati Yatra' - his record 14th yatra - on December 23. But all is not well between the NDA coalition partners.\n\"The statements coming from BJP's state leadership will not satisfy either Nitish or his coterie. They want a clarification from the senior BJP leadership in Delhi,\" says Ravi Upadhyay, a senior journalist based in Patna.\n\"Nitish's actions and reactions are instant. He hits out intelligently. There is an ongoing political turmoil in Bihar. JDU is alert after the turn of events in Maharashtra,\" adds Upadhyay.\nNK Chaudhury, a senior political analyst, says, \"JDU and Nitish are both jittery after Shah's comments. BJP is only testing waters as it cannot afford to antagonise JDU at this juncture. With Nitish, nothing can be ruled out.

{"title": "Denmark Strengthens Greenland Security and Deploys Sled Dogs After Trump's US Takeover Threat", "text": "US President-elect Donald Trump once again caused international controversy through provocative comments about acquiring Greenland, reclaiming the Panama Canal, and jokingly suggesting annexation of Canada. Trump has reignited his earlier, unsuccessful calls to buy Greenland from Denmark, further intensifying tensions with allied nations even before officially taking office on January 20. The Danish government has reacted by promising the largest defense spending boost to Greenland since Trump's revived push for the Arctic region.\nDanish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told BBC, the package was a \"double digit billion amount\" in krone, or at least $1.5bn. He described the timing of the announcement as an \"irony of fate\". On Monday Trump said ownership and control of the huge island was an \"absolute necessity\" for the US.\nPoulsen said the package would allow for the purchase of two new inspection ships, two new long-range drones and two extra dog sled teams.\nIt would also include funding for increased staffing at Arctic Command in the capital Nuuk and an upgrade for one of Greenland's three main civilian airports to handle F-35 supersonic fighter aircraft.\n\"We have not invested enough in the Arctic for many years, now we are planning a stronger presence,\" he said.\nThe defence minister did not give an exact figure for the package, but Danish media estimated it would be around 12-15bn krone.\nThe announcement came a day after Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social: \"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\"\nGreenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede responded to Trump's comments, saying \"we are not for sale\".\nWhat is Greenland and what is its territorial status?\nGreenland, the world's largest island, is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.

{"title": "Why Christmas In Japan Is Celebrated Like A Second Valentine's Day For Couples", "text": "Churches worldwide celebrated Christmas on Wednesday, honouring the birth of Jesus with prayers, Masses, and cultural events. Families observed traditions like fasting, setting up cribs, and awaiting Santa Claus. Processions and prayers added spiritual fervour, uniting communities in joyous celebrations of the Nativity and the birth of Christ. But in Japan Christmas is celebrated for a very different reason, especially by couples. Unlike the traditional Christian observance, the festive season in Japan is seen as a romantic occasion, according to CNN.\nWith the holiday season coinciding with the chilly winter weather, Christmas provides the perfect atmosphere for couples to unwind and enjoy each other's company in a country where people are often overwhelmed by work. Restaurants and shopping centres take full advantage of the opportunity and provide special dinner sets as well as discount gifts, such as chocolates to jewellery, for couples. This, in turn, brings the festive feel throughout the nation, as couples visit restaurants and shopping malls to celebrate on their own. For most, it's not the religious but a great chance to spend time together amidst all the beauty that winter can offer.\n\"It's all about mood and atmosphere,\" associate professor Roy Starrs, who specialises in Japanese studies at the University of Otago in New Zealand, tells CNN Travel.\n\"Young couples go out together on dates once it gets dark to view the spectacular displays of colourful lights, and this is thought to be a very romantic atmosphere conducive to young love.\"\nA country of 124 million, Japan's most-followed religion is Shintoism, with less than one percent of its population being Christian. And yet, the nation celebrates Christmas in full spirit.\n\"Most Japanese do not view Christmas as any kind of religious event but as a pop-cultural spectacle imported from the West-an aesthetically pleasing melange of bright lights, Santa Claus dolls, Christmas markets, colourfully wrapped gifts, and Christmas cakes,\" says Starrs.\nJapan is a society that values aesthetics highly, he adds, so it makes sense that these festive displays, often accompanied by ample snow, concoct the perfect recipe for a romantic white Christmas.\nMeanwhile, Pope Francis, leading the world's 1.3 billion Roman Catholics, celebrated a solemn Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The Mass was a significant moment, marking the 12th Christmas of his pontificate. During the service, the pontiff also officially inaugurated the 2025 Catholic Holy Year, a special observance expected to draw around 32 million tourists to Rome next year. Across the world, people joined in the spirit of Christmas, reflecting on the message of peace, love, and hope that the holiday brings while also honouring the traditions and customs that have been passed down through generations.", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/feature/why-christmas-in-japan-is-celebrated-like-a-second-valentines-day-for-couples-7326874", "authors": ["Nikhil Pandey"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "A country of 124 million, Japan's most-followed religion is Shintoism, with less than one percent of its population being Christian."}
{"title": "All About Pakistan Taliban, Terror Group Islamabad Attacked Inside Afghanistan Border", "text": "Peshawar, Pakistan:\nIn rare airstrikes, Pakistan on Tuesday targeted multiple suspected hideouts of the Pakistani Taliban inside neighbouring Afghanistan, resulting in the death of at least 15 people, including women and children. The strikes were carried out in a mountainous area in Paktika province bordering Pakistan, where the local authorities said the number of deaths is expected to rise.\nThe strike also dismantled a training facility and killed some insurgents, Pakistani security officials told the Associated Press (AP) on the condition of anonymity.\nIt was reportedly the second such Pakistani attack on alleged hideouts of the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), since March in the border regions inside Afghanistan. Islamabad often claims that the TTP use Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan, a charge Kabul has denied.\nAbout Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan\nTehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of various hardline Sunni Islamist groups operating individually in Pakistan, following Pakistan military operations against Al-Qaida-related terrorists in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)-- a semi-autonomous region in the northwest region of the country that was made up of seven tribal agencies and six frontier regions.\nFormed under the leadership of Baitullah Mehsud, who has since died, TTP is rooted along the Afghanistan/Pakistan border. Some estimates suggest TTP has between 30,000 and 35,000 members.\nAccording to the United Nations, its stated objective is the overthrow of the elected government of Pakistan to establish an emirate based on its interpretation of Islamic law. To that end, TTP has worked to destabilize Pakistan by directly attacking the Pakistani army and assassinating politicians. Its attacks, which have included multiple suicide bombings, have killed hundreds of members of the Pakistan defence forces, law enforcement personnel and civilians.\nThe terrorist group is responsible for some of the bloodiest attacks in Pakistan, including on churches, schools and the shooting of Malala Yousafzai, who survived the 2012 attack after she was targeted for her campaign against the Taliban's efforts to deny women education.\nAfter the Afghan Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, it emboldened the TTP, whose leaders and fighters are hiding in Afghanistan. The terrorist organisation has stepped up attacks on Pakistani soldiers and police since November 2022, when it unilaterally ended a cease-fire with the government after the failure of months of talks hosted by Afghanistan's government in Kabul. The TTP in recent months has killed and wounded dozens of soldiers in attacks inside the country.\nKabul's Reaction\nIn Kabul, the Afghan Defense Ministry condemned the Pakistani airstrikes, saying the bombing targeted civilians, including women and children. It said that most of the victims were refugees from the Waziristan region.\n\"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,\" the ministry said.\nIn a post on the X platform, the Afghan defence ministry said the Pakistani side should know that such unilateral measures are not a solution to any problem. \"The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defence of its territory and territory to be its inalienable right,\" it said.\nSyed Muhammad Ali, an Islamabad-based security expert told AP that Tuesday's airstrike \"represents a clear and blunt warning to Pakistani Taliban that Pakistan will use all the available means against the terrorist outfit both inside and outside its borders.\"\n\"However, it is not an indiscriminate use of force and due care was taken by Pakistan in ensuring that only the terrorist bases were hit and no civilian loss of life and property took place,\" he said.\nTiming Of The Attack\nThe strikes came hours after Pakistan's special representative for Afghanistan, Mohammad Sadiq, travelled to Kabul to discuss a range of issues, including how to enhance bilateral trade and improve ties.\nDuring the visit, Mr Sadiq met with Sirajuddin Haqqani, Afghanistan's acting interior minister, to offer his condolences over the December 11 killing of his uncle Khalil Haqqani.\nKhalil Haqqani was the minister for refugees and repatriation who died in a suicide bombing that was claimed by a regional affiliate of the Islamic State group.\nIn a post on X, the Pakistani Minister said he also met with Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and he \"held wide-ranging discussions.

{"title": "South Korea Launches Speed Dating Events To Combat Declining Marriage And Birth Rates", "text": "The demographic challenge South Korea faces has been persistent; it continues to grapple with declining marriage and birth rates, according to BBC. Although private matchmaking services have been on the rise, marriage rates are at a record low in South Korea, compelling the government to take action.\nAs per the news report, in 2023, there were 40% fewer marriages in South Korea compared to a decade ago; the trend here is delaying or avoiding marriage. At the same time, South Korea's total fertility rate, which shows the average number of children a woman is expected to have throughout her lifetime, hit its all-time low of only 0.72; it is also the world's lowest rate.\nExperts cite several causes of such statistics, such as the long working hours associated with South Korea. The average worker in South Korea clocked in the world's longest working hours after Mexico in 2017. The work-life balance is poor, and there is sky-high housing along with very expensive childcare which dissuades many from either beginning families or coming back to work after delivery.\nIn response to these negative demographic trends, the South Korean government has initiated a series of speed dating events, hoping to encourage marriage and address the country's low fertility rate. The government-sponsored matchmaking events are part of a broader effort to tackle the nation's declining population and the social challenges that come with it.\nAccording to a 2023 Bloomberg report, the city of Seongnam has taken on the role of matchmaker in response to South Korea's fertility crisis. Led by Mayor Shin Sang-jin, the city's government-run dating events are a key part of a larger initiative aimed at combating the country's declining birth rates.\nUnder the guidance of a dating coach, participants-chosen from more than 2,500 qualified applicants-played games and connected through rounds of speed dating in balloon-filled rooms. Wine, chocolate, and a free makeup station were provided by the city at each event. Due to popular demand, the city is now considering expanding the program. Shin's initiative has drawn global attention for its bold-if somewhat controversial-approach to the fertility crisis facing many countries.\nKorea's capital, Seoul, has also considered hosting its own matchmaking events, though officials there have put the idea on pause following criticisms that such programs fail to address the root causes of the fertility challenge.", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-korea-launches-speed-dating-events-to-combat-declining-marriage-and-birth-rates-7326519", "authors": ["Nikhil Pandey"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "South Korea faces a demographic crisis marked by record-low marriage and birth rates, with a fertility rate of just 0.72, the world's lowest.

{"title": "As Google Faces A Grave And Uncertain Future, Apple Steps In. Here's Why", "text": "Washington DC:\nTwo of the world's largest tech behemoths - Apple and Google - are participating together in what is increasingly seeming like an indefensible case. Billions and billions are at stake and Google, the world's 'default' search engine, stares into the abyss.\nThere is much to lose for both tech giants - for Apple it could lead to losses worth tens of billions of dollars per year and an incomprehensible fallout on the accuracy of its results on features like Siri and Spotlight, whose framework is largely dependent on Google search. For Google, besides money and market share, it may result in the massive loss of its entire web browser - Chrome. It also faces another potential gigantic loss - its Android operating system.\nAnd so, finding Google in a major spot of bother, Apple has sought to participate in the anti-trust trial against Google over its internet search engine. Apple on Tuesday said it needs to step in as it cannot rely on Google alone to defend the revenue-sharing agreements that the two firms have.\nThe epicenter of the case, which has sent tremors across Silicon Valley, lies in an agreement between Google and Apple, wherein the iPhone, iPad, and Macbook maker gets tens of billions of dollars each year for making Google the default search engine on its browser - Safari. In 2022 alone, Apple reportedly received in excess of $20 billion as a result of this very agreement.\nThe question at the heart of the case is simple - Has Google monopolised online search? According to Google - No, it has not.\nA monopoly in simple business terms is a situation where a single company controls the entire market. In such a scenario it becomes difficult or sometimes impossible for the competition to compete due to the lack of a level-playing field.\nFocusing on this very point, Apple's lawyers submitted their papers to the court on Tuesday, in which they conveyed that Apple and Google are not competitors, and neither does Apple want to compete in the search engine space. It also said that that is how it will be whether or not Apple receives the billions of dollars from Google in future.\nApple, in its petition, also said it wants to call witnesses who will testify under oath at the trial scheduled for April 2025. On that day, the prosecutors will aim to highlight that Google absolutely must take multiple measures - two of them being selling its Chrome browser and possibly its Android operating system too. The prosecutors believe that only then will competition be restored in online search. But should this happen, it will be a fatal blow to Google.\nWhile Google's parent firm Alphabet is figuring a way to battle this grave threat to its existence, Apple, which understand the gravity of the situation has said \"Google can no longer adequately represent Apple's interests. Google must now defend against a broad effort to break up its business units.\"\nMeanwhile, justifying its stand, Google has asserted that the entire premise of the case is based on exclusive deals - and that is what the focus of the case should be on, instead of an aim to breaking Google. It has even offered to put an end to such deals in future.\nBesides ending the deal with Apple, Google has even suggested that it is willing to no longer enter any agreement with Android phone manufacturers which require the phone-maker to set Google as the default search engine in return for its operating system and supporting apps. Google also said that browser companies like Mozilla would be given more flexibility in setting rival search engines as its default search. This, according to Google's lawyers, is a fair solution to make the market more competitive.\nBetween now and the crucial hearing in April, Google is doing all it can to defend itself and limit its losses, should it lose the groundbreaking case.", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/as-google-faces-a-grave-and-uncertain-future-apple-steps-in-heres-why-7324986", "authors": ["Abhishek Chakraborty"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Two of the world's largest tech behemoths - Apple and Google - are coming together in what is increasingly seeming like an indefensible case.

The investigation revealed that Singh had been living in his car on the driveway of the home, and on the day of the murder, Kaur had let him into the house.\nCCTV evidence showed Singh leaving the property later on the same day and going to purchase a sack and spade from a nearby shop. He then returned to the house on Bolsover Street and when relatives were unable to get hold of Kaur, they went to her home where they discovered her body.

{"title": "Indian-Origin Professor Complains Of Low Salaries In UK Universities: \"Absolute Joke\"", "text": "An Indian-origin professor In the UK has voiced concerns about the country's salary structure, particularly for contractual academic staff, warning that low wages are leading to a brain drain. Anant Sudarshan, an Associate Professor at the University of Warwick's Department of Economics, took to X to highlight the issue, revealing that UK academic salaries have become so uncompetitive that he has lost potential hires to Indian universities.\n\"UK salaries are becoming an absolute joke, especially for contractual staff. I have failed to hire people eligible for the UK's special high-potential individual visa because a government* university in India is willing to pay them slightly more in absolute terms than here,\" he wrote on X.\nAlthough the UK may appear attractive on paper due to purchasing power parity, Mr Sudarshan noted that the country is losing its appeal to top academic talent worldwide. \"To be clear - there is no comparison in absolute terms on average and thus for most people (although PPP looks different). But on the margins, for the best people, the UK is now stunningly unattractive, especially in academia,\" he added.\nSee the tweet here:\nThe professor also responded to criticism that his comparison was flawed, providing further clarification on his earlier statement. He explained that while India's UGC pay scales may be lower, some short-term project staff in India can earn more in absolute terms than their UK counterparts. He noted that some UK contract teachers earn around 30,000 pounds (approximately Rs 30 lakh) annually. However, when adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), this amount is equivalent to about Rs 7.5 lakh per year, which is comparable to or even lower than what some Indian project staff earn.\nThe debate took a racist turn when some users criticised him for considering hiring international candidates over UK citizens. A few even suggested he \"go back\" to his home country.\nWhen someone suggested that he \"Hire citizens,\" he responded by emphasising that the issue isn't about citizenship, but rather about the low pay. He clarified that the low salaries affect everyone, regardless of citizenship, stating, \"The point isn't whether someone is a citizen or not. The point is whoever is hired is paid too little – citizens don't get more.\"\nAnother user said, \"Why anyone would live in the UK is beyond me. The US has much higher pay and better research. Australia has far better weather. Europe has a better quality of life. India has much better food and culture. On top of that the rudeness, racism and lack of safety.\"", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/feature/indian-origin-professor-complains-of-low-academic-salaries-in-uk-universities-absolute-joke-7278960", "authors": ["Ritu Singh"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Anant Sudarshan took to X to highlight the issue, revealing that UK academic salaries have become so uncompetitive that he has lost potential hires to Indian universities."}

{"title": "What OpenAI Whistleblower Suchir Balaji Revealed About The Dark Side Of AI Before Death", "text": "San Francisco, US:\nSuchir Balaji, the 26-year-old OpenAI researcher-turned-whistleblower, was found dead in an apartment in San Francisco, US last month. His death on November 26 was determined suicide by the San Francisco medical examiner's office as police found no evidence of wrong doing.\nBalaji, who left OpenAI in August, has spoken out against the artificial intelligence company's practice of training the chatbot on copyrighted material scraped from the internet very openly in recent months. The artificial intelligence (AI) giant has been fighting several lawsuits relating to its data-gathering practices.\nAbout Suchir Balaji\nIndian American Suchir Balaji grew up in Cupertino, California. A remarkably sharp kid, he excelled in programming contests, placing 31st in the ACM ICPC 2018 World Finals and winning first place in the 2017 Pacific Northwest Regional and Berkeley Programming Contests.\nBalaji also secured 7th place in Kaggle's TSA-sponsored \"Passenger Screening Algorithm Challenge,\" earning a $100,000 prize. Per his LinkedIn profile, he was the US Open 2016 National Champion and a USACO Finalist.\nLike most others in his field, Balaji had been captivated by the promise of artificial intelligence since an early age. In an interview given to the New York Times in October, he mentioned his interest in AI started after he stumbled across a news story about the technology in his teens and imagined that neural networks could solve humanity's greatest problems.\n\"I thought that AI was a thing that could be used to solve unsolvable problems, like curing diseases and stopping ageing...I thought we could invent some kind of scientist that could help solve them,\" he said, according to the NYT report.\nEven before graduating, he worked at Scale AI, Helia, and was a Software Engineer at Quora. In 2020, Balaji joined a stream of Berkeley grads who went to work for OpenAI.\nSuchir Balaji's Time At OpenAI\nHe worked at OpenAI for four years, during which for one and half years, he helped gather and organize the enormous amounts of internet data the company used to build its online chatbot, ChatGPT.\nBalaji told NYT that during his initial data at OpenAI, he did not carefully consider whether the company had a legal right to build its products using both copyrighted and open internet data. It was only after the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 that he started to contemplate the issue and realised that technologies like ChatGPT were damaging the internet by using copyrighted data, violating the law in the process.\nBy 2024, Balaji said realised \"he no longer wanted to contribute to technologies that he believed would bring society more harm than benefit.\" He left the company in August this year without any new job and started working on what he called \"personal projects.\"\nHe died a day after he was named in a court filing as someone whose files OpenAI would search as part of a lawsuit brought by those who sued the AI giant.\nSuchir Balaji's Allegation Against OpenAI\nAfter leaving OpenAI, Suchir Balaji spoke out publicly against the way AI companies are using copyrighted data to create their technologies. He alleged that the AI models were too dependent on the labour of others as they are trained on copyrighted material scraped from the internet without authorisation.\n\"This is not a sustainable model for the internet ecosystem as a whole,\" he told the NYT.\nHe also explained his concerns on his personal website, where he noted that while generative models rarely produce outputs identical to their training data, the act of replicating copyrighted material during training could violate laws if not protected under \"fair use.\"\n\"Because fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, no broad statement can be made about when generative AI qualifies for fair use,\" he noted.\nBalaji argued in several cases the chatbots directly compete with the copyrighted works they learned from. \"Generative models are designed to imitate online data, so they can substitute for \"basically anything\" on the internet, from news stories to online forums,\" he said.\nAccording to him, the biggest problem is that with AI technologies gradually replacing existing internet services, they sometimes produce \"false and sometimes completely made-up information - what researchers call \"hallucinations.\"\"\nThe internet, he said, is changing for the worse.\nAllegations Against AI Companies\nBalaji was not alone in his concerns about AI companies misusing copyrighter data to train their chatbots. Several US and Canadian news publishers, including the New York Times, have filed lawsuits against OpenAI and its primary partner, Microsoft, claiming they used millions of their articles to build chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.\nMany best-selling writers, including John Grisham, also have filed lawsuits against the company.\nOpenAI Disputes Claims\nOpenAI has disputed Balaji's claims, insisting that their data use adhered to fair use principles and legal precedents.\n\"We build our AI models using publicly available data, in a manner protected by fair use and related principles, and supported by longstanding and widely accepted legal precedents. We view this principle as fair to creators, necessary for innovators, and critical for US competitiveness,\" OpenAI said in a statement.\nThe company told BBC in November that its software is \"grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation\".\nReacting to BAlaji's death, a spokesperson for OpenAI said, \"We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones during this difficult time.\"", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-openai-whistleblower-suchir-balaji-revealed-about-the-dark-side-of-ai-7254038", "authors": ["Sanstuti Nath"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Suchir Balaji, the 26-year-old OpenAI researcher-turned-whistleblower, was found dead in an apartment in San Francisco, US last month.

During an interview with PAK TV, Fakhar said that he was not criticising PCB and added that he was merely expressing his own opinion.\n\"I thought about it later and felt that I should not have tweeted. But people got the tweet completely wrong. They thought that I was criticising the decision of the board, but this is 100 per cent wrong. If you see the timing of the tweet, it was done before the board made its decision. I saw in the news for 2-3 days that journalists and former players were criticising him (Babar Azam). And I thought to myself, Babar has done so much for the team, but they still wanted him to be dropped,\" Fakhar said in the interview.\n\"I saw that and tweeted my opinion out. But I understand that no one is bigger than the board. I will even tell my junior cricketers that however big you become, you are not bigger than the board and you should not be criticising them during your playing days. But ya, my clarification is that I made my tweet before the team was announced,\" he further added.\nWhile Fakhar was dropped from the central contracts list, PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi made it clear that it was not just about the social media post. He added that Fakhar's performances have not been up to the mark lately and even pointed out that his fitness was one of the main reasons behind the decision.\n\"Tweet was one issue, but the bigger matter was that of fitness. There is a show-cause notice pending against him, and we will see about that. He would need to prove his fitness, his point of view was valued in the Connection Camp and I am very thankful to him for that but you cannot go around commenting on the selection committee over selection calls. But ya, the bigger issue is of selection,\" Mohsin Naqvi said in the press conference while announcing fresh contracts.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/pakistan-star-breaks-silence-on-backlash-over-controversial-virat-kohli-babar-azam-take-7321538", "authors": ["NDTV Sports Desk"], "date_publish": "2022-07-05T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Pakistan cricket team batter Fakhar Zaman opened up about his controversial Virat Kohli-Babar Azam post on social media and the backlash that he faced over it."}
{"title": "\"Kid In The Backyard...\": Pat Cummins' Hilarious Advice To 19-Year-Old Debutant Sam Konstas", "text": "Ahead of the fourth Test against India, Australian skipper Pat Cummins had a special message for the 19-year-old debutant Sam Kontas, urging the batter to enjoy being a part of the Boxing Day Test, and not overthink it. The U19 ICC World Cup winning star Konstas, having built heavy hype for himself following a string of powerful performances at the domestic level for New South Wales (NSW), will have a chance at justifying it as he takes on an Indian attack led by a world-class Jasprit Bumrah, which will no doubt be motivated to do better and take a 2-1 series lead after drawing the third Test at Brisbane from an almost unwinnable position. Speaking during the pre-match presser as quoted by cricket.com.au, Cummins reminisced about his international debut in November 2011 against South Africa, in which he took seven wickets across both innings including a six-wicket haul. Cummins said that even he was as excited as Konstas was before his debut. He also said that when players start, there is a \"level of naivety\" as they want to take the game on as if it Is \"backyard\" cricket.\n\"It was pretty awesome. I spent a bit of the time wondering why, or how, I was there and how it happened so quickly. I just remember being really excited,\" said Cummins.\n\"I think it is similar to Sammy (Konstas) this week. There is a level of naivety that you just want to go out and play like you do when you are a kid in the backyard. You just want to take the game on, have fun, and not overthink it.\"\n\"That is the message to Sam. That is definitely how I felt as an 18-year-old. I was just really excited, and once the game started, you go into game mode and it's just like any other game,\" he concluded his point.\nThe Aussie captain also hilariously recalled how as an 18-year-old, he felt that he had more leeway in case of a bad game and it was the selector's fault for selecting him at such a young age.\n\"I remember as an 18-year-old I was thinking, 'I have got a lot more leeway because I was young' - almost publicly - so I almost felt like, if I did not have a great game, it was not my fault - it was the selectors' fault for picking me,\" he said.\n\"I was like, 'well, they're the idiots that picked an 18-year-old!' You are so young starting out your career - it is Boxing Day, it does not get any better than this. So just enjoy the moment,\" he signed off.\nKonstas played a vital role in Australia's ICC U19 World Cup 2024 triumph, scoring 191 runs in seven innings at an average of 27.28, including a century. He also featured in a two-match series between Australia A and India A ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, scoring 92 runs in four innings, highlighted by a match-winning 73*. In the warm-up pink-ball game against India, he stamped his authority with a classy 107 off 97 balls against a formidable Indian attack.\nIn the ongoing Sheffield Shield season, Konstas is the fifth-highest run-getter with 471 runs in five matches at an average of 58.87, including two centuries and a fifty, with a best score of 152.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/kid-in-the-backyard-pat-cummins-hilarious-advice-to-19-year-old-debutant-sam-konstas-7326749", "authors": ["Asian News International"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Ahead of the fourth Test against India, Australian skipper Pat Cummins had a special message for the 19-year-old debutant Sam Kontas, urging the batter to enjoy being a part of the Boxing Day Test, and not overthink it."}
{"title": "\"I Am MVP Of My Cricket, Not Rohit Sharma Or Virat Kohli\": Ravichandran Ashwin", "text": "Ever since India all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin announced his sudden retirement from international cricket, tributes have been pouring in from all corners for the veteran cricketer. However, Ashwin doesn't want people to celebrate his career or worship him. For him, the sport is above all individuals. However, the owner of 537 Test wickets said that he does want to burst a few cricketing myths. Former England captains Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain had a detailed virtual conversation with Ashwin, who is currently in Chennai following his retirement from international cricket.\nDuring the interaction, Ashwin gave some interesting insights into his memoir \"I Have The Streets: A Kutty Cricket Story\" which was released earlier this year in July. During the chat, Ashwin opened up on one of the biggest myths about him. He said that people think that he is too serious and doesn't enjoy the game as much as someone like Virat Kohli.\nHowever, Ashwin's insisted that's not the case, adding that he gets lost while playing cricket.\n\"I wanted people to know me for who I am, because a lot of times, Ashwin's picking up a wicket and Virat Kohli is all over the place. He's just jumping about and people very often tend to believe that Ashwin's the one that's absolutely serious and Virat's the one that's having all the fun, which is why somebody asked me the question, why are you serious all the time? My answer to that in the first place is I'm never a serious person, but when somebody is clobbering me and I have the ball in my hand to win a Test Match for my country, my mind is sticking, because I'm in the process. So very often, you don't see me picking up a five-wicket haul and pushing across a kiss through the blade of my bat to my better half sitting in the dressing room or sitting in the hospitality box. So I felt like a lot of who I am got diluted in the fact of what I've become. So I wanted to bring that out in my book,\" Ashwin said on Sky Sports.\nIndian cricket has been blessed to witness greats of the game like Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, who often get worshipped like gods.However, Ashwin feels it's harsh to sideline others as cricket is a team sport. But, for Ashwin, he has always been the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of his own story.\n\"A lot of people talk about, when they talk about Indian cricket, that's one thing I want to change over the years. They talk about Virat Kohli, they have been talking about Rohit over the years. When I grew up, I spoke a lot about Sachin, I spoke about other superstars, the celebrities. One message I would leave for everybody and I want to constantly change is that it's not the fact that these are glorious cricketers but people on the outside who believe that everyone plays a support cast are extremely wrong because this is a sport. An MVP in my life, for my dad or for my mom, I am the MVP. It's not Rohit, Virat or somebody on the outside, likewise, everyone's journey is unique. For me, I have always been the MVP and I am the MVP of my cricket,\" he added.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/i-am-mvp-of-my-cricket-not-rohit-sharma-or-virat-kohli-ravichandran-ashwin-7320637", "authors": ["NDTV Sports Desk"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Ravichandran Ashwin doesn't want people to celebrate his career or worship him."}

Kambli (52) is responding to the treatment for urinary tract infections for which he was admitted at Akruti Hospital near Bhiwandi town on Saturday (December 21), Dr Vivek Trivedi told PTI. Trivedi is heading the medical team that is supervising the former cricketer's health. Doctors were planning to do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) on the former India batter, but since he has developed a fever, a decision on the non-invasive medical procedure will be taken later, he said.

With the series tied at 1-1 after three matches, this match is extremely important when it comes to the World Test Championship (WTC) Final dreams for both sides. Just after practice ended on Tuesday, a female fan repeatedly urged Rohit to call Shubman Gill and said that she was his fan. In a video by Revsportz, Rohit was seen gesturing towards the fan to come back later as Gill had already finished his training. However, the fan kept shouting for Gill prompting Rohit to respond loudly - “Kaha se lau?

He has got so much talent, when you have a guy like him, you don't want to tamper too much with his mindset.\n\"Let him be as free as possible and not over-burden him with too many thoughts regarding his batting.

Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, who is gunning for a third Melbourne Park trophy, joins him at the Queensland Tennis Centre from December 29-January 5 in a stellar women's field. The 2025 season gets under way on Friday with the mixed-teams United Cup in Perth and Sydney, headlined by world number two Iga Swiatek in her first tournament since revelations that she served a one-month doping suspension.\nIt is the first season since 37-year-old Djokovic began playing that none of the other so-called \"Big Four\" will be on the other side of the net following the retirements this year of Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray.\nRoger Federer called it quits in 2022.\nAs they faded, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz stepped up to become the new Grand Slam kings, with both men opting against a warm-up tournament leading into the first major of the year which begins on January 12.\nAs doubts grew over Djokovic's motivation and ability to take down the new guard after a disappointing 2024, he stunned the tennis world by hiring Murray to coach him.\nThe British three-time major winner is set to miss Brisbane but hook up with his old rival at the Australian Open.\n\"I still will try to go strong because I feel like my body is serving me well. I still have motivation to win Grand Slams, make more history,\" said Djokovic, who needs one more Slam crown to surpass Margaret Court's 24.\n\"That's one of the biggest reasons why I asked Andy to work with me, because I still have big plans, so as long as that's the case, I will keep going.\"\nBy his standards, 2024 wasn't kind, failing to win a Slam, claiming just one title -- Olympic gold in Paris -- and ending his season in October.\nA resurgent Grigor Dimitrov, Holger Rune, and Frances Tiafoe are also playing in Brisbane, as is Australian Nick Kyrgios, who returns after injuries restricted him to just one ATP Tour singles match in two years.\nHe and Djokovic are set to play doubles together.\nAdvertisement\nChallenging Sabalenka on Pat Rafter Arena will be America's top talents Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro, ranked seven and eight respectively, along with former world number two Ons Jabeur and veteran Victoria Azarenka.\nSabalenka, who beat China's high-flying Zheng Qinwen in the Melbourne final this year, had a sensational 2024 which culminated in being named WTA Player of Year this month.\nThe 26-year-old reached seven finals and won four titles, successfully defending the Australian Open, lifting her first US Open and winning WTA 1000 events in Cincinnati and Wuhan.\nShe also recaptured the number one ranking from five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek, whose reputation was rocked in November when it was revealed she tested positive for a banned heart medication in August.\nThe International Tennis Integrity Agency accepted that the violation was not intentional, and the Polish star escaped with a one-month sanction.\nSwiatek called it \"the worst experience of my life\", but vowed: \"I know I will be stronger than ever.\"\nHer case is similar to that of Australian Open winner Sinner, who is still waiting for the outcome of a World Anti-Doping Agency appeal against his initial exoneration for twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.\nThe agency told AFP a ruling was not expected before the new year, but it could conceivably be handed down before or during the Australian Open.\nJoining Swiatek at the United Cup is world number two Coco Gauff and fourth-ranked Jasmine Paolini.\nTwo-time Australian Open winner Naomi Osaka begins her season at the Auckland Classic, hoping for a better year than 2024 when she failed to win a title.\nFormer US Open champions Emma Raducanu, a place above Osaka in the rankings at 57, and Bianca Andreescu are also starters in New Zealand.\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/novak-djokovic-eyes-more-slam-glory-as-iga-swiatek-returns-under-doping-cloud-7326395", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "date_publish": "2024-08-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Novak Djokovic is confident he can still win Grand Slams, starting at the Australian Open, with the Serbian kickstarting his bid for an unprecedented 11th titleand record 25th major crown in Brisbane."}

As the reported 30-athlete list came out, the ace shooter's name was nowhere to be seen despite her historic accomplishments at the Paris Games. Manu Bhaker's father Ram Kishan was left fuming with the development, as he lashed out at the sports ministry, and government officials for leaving out his daughter's name from the list despite claiming that an application was submitted.\nA heartbroken Ram Kishan posed some potent questions, asking if Manu's twin bronze medals at the Paris Games were even worth it as she still has to 'beg' for awards in her own country. Mr. Bhaker even criticised the committee members deciding the shortlist for maintaining silence on the matter.\n\"What's the point of getting two medals in a single Olympics if you have to beg for awards,\" Ram Kishan said in a chat with Sports Tak. \"One government official is deciding and committee members are silent not giving their opinion. I don't understand. Is this the way you are encouraging athletes?\"\nRam Kishan went on to say that Manu had applied for the award but hadn't heard back from the committee year. \"We had applied for the award but have heard nothing from the committee,\" he claimed.\nThe shooter's father expressed his frustration and disappointment at the controversy, suggesting such a lack of support would make parents think twice before pushing their children to pursue careers in sports.\n\"Why parents are encouraging their kids to play they should push them to become IRS officers in government,\" he said.\nRecent developments in the matter suggest that the sports ministry might take a u-turn on the matter and decide to nominate Manu for the Khel Ratna award. The shooter herself hasn't publicly shared her stance on the matter, with reactions only coming through her father.\nManu had gone to Udaipur to attend the wedding of Indian badminton star PV Sindhu.

{"title": "Greg Chappell Lauds Travid Heads Fearless Approach Against Jasprit Bumrah", "text": "Former Australian cricketer Greg Chappell has heaped praise on Travis Head for his audacious and effective approach against India's pace spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah, during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. In his column for The Sydney Morning Herald, Chappell highlighted Head's ability to not just survive against Bumrah but also counter-attack, disrupting the rhythm of one of the world's most formidable bowlers. Head's performances against Bumrah stand out in a series where many batters have struggled against the Ahmedabad-born pacer's unorthodox action, searing pace, and pinpoint accuracy. Bumrah has picked up 21 wickets in three Tests at a jaw-dropping average of 10.90. Despite Bumrah dismissing Head twice, the left-hander has managed to score 83 runs off him at an average of 41.5 and a blistering strike rate of 91.2.\nChappell emphasised Head's fearless intent and proactive mindset in his approach to tackling Bumrah. “Head's performances against Jasprit Bumrah in this series exemplify his fearless approach,” Chappell wrote.\n“While most batsmen struggle to survive Bumrah's unorthodox action, sharp pace, and relentless accuracy, Head has treated him like any other bowler. By playing with intent and looking to score off Bumrah, Head has not only nullified his threat but disrupted his rhythm.”\nChappell further praised Head's technical proficiency, especially his ability to dominate short-pitched deliveries and execute precision drives to fuller ones. “His ability to dispatch short deliveries with authority and drive fuller ones with precision has been remarkable, underscoring the strides he has made,” the former Indian head coach added.\nHead's fearless batting has been a key component in Australia's performances in the series. His quick-fire 140 in the pink-ball Test came when Australia were under pressure at 103/3, a knock that shifted the momentum back in their favour. In the third Test in Brisbane, Head's monumental 152 off 160 balls, which included a mammoth 241-run partnership with Steve Smith, further showcased his ability to dominate world-class bowlers in challenging conditions.\nBeyond his batting prowess, Chappell believes Head's consistency across formats and his temperament make him a strong contender to succeed Pat Cummins as Australia's captain. The 76-year-old wrote, “I believe Travis to be the most improved batter in world cricket in the past three years and in becoming so, has firmed in favouritism to be the next Australian captain. In his current form, Travis exemplifies the Australian way of batting.”\nChappell also aligned his views with those of former Australian players Ricky Ponting and Ian Healy, who have been vocal in their admiration for Head. “I couldn't take my eyes off the screen when he was batting in the Brisbane Test,” Chappell remarked.\nWith the series locked at 1-1, the upcoming Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, starting on Thursday will be pivotal for both teams.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/greg-chappell-lauds-travid-heads-fearless-approach-against-jasprit-bumrah-7324692", "authors": [], "date_publish": "2024-11-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Chappell emphasised Heads fearless intent and proactive mindset in his approach to tackling Bumrah"}

The victory also propelled India to an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Deol (115, 103b, 16x4) powered India's record-equalling 358 for five and she received ample support from Pratika Rawal (76, 86b, 10x4, 1x6), Smriti Mandhana (53, 47b, 7x4, 2x6) and Jemimah Rodrigues (52, 36b, 6x4, 1x6).\nThe task of chasing 359 was always going to be out of Windies' reach, and they were bowled out for 243 despite skipper Hayley Matthews making a flowing hundred (106, 109b, 13x4).\nThe writing on the wall was clear once the Indian bowlers reduced Windies to 69 for four inside the first 20 overs.\nBut Matthews added 112 runs for the fifth wicket with Shemaine Campbelle (38) to delay the inevitable.\nMatthews, who reached her seventh ODI hundred in 99 balls, stood out for the power and precision until she fell to off-spinner Rawal.\nThe Indian bowlers also deserve a good chunk of credit for sticking to good lines on a slightly spongy wicket.\nThey attacked the stumps regularly and leg-spinner Priya Mishra was splendid while mixing up leg-breaks and googles without any visible change in action.\nApart from Priya (3/49), pacer Titas Sadhu (2/42) and seasoned spinner Deepti Sharma (2/40) were the pick of Indian bowlers.\nEarlier, Deol's impressive coming-of-age hundred powered India's batting effort that saw them equalling their highest-ever ODI total, which was also the highest total any team has made against the Caribbeans.\nThe Indian management will be mighty pleased by Deol's hundred as she marked her growth as an all-field player from a predominantly off-side batter during this knock.\nNot precisely a power-hitter, the right-hander has added more nuances to her batting through the ability to find angles and gaps.\nAdvertisement\nIt was evident when she peppered Deandra Dottin for three fours through fine leg, point and behind point to move into the 90s.\nHer 100 came along with a nicely-timed boundary off pacer Shamilia Connell in 98 balls.\nBut for an imposing total, India should also thank Mandhana and Rawal for adding 110 runs off the opening wicket in just 16.3 overs, their second successive 100-run partnership in ODIs.\nThey looked hardly in any trouble until some lethargic running between the wicket resulted in Mandhana's run out.\nRawal, who raised her maiden ODI fifty in 58 balls, looked well settled for a hundred in only her second 50-over game, but the right-hander failed to negotiate Zaida James' delivery with a bit of extra bounce, scooping it to Qiana Joseph at short mid-wicket.\nShe added 62 runs for the second wicket with Deol.\nSkipper Harmanpreet Kaur could not produce a big one, getting bowled in her attempt to slog sweep Afy Fletcher's full-length delivery.\nWest Indies might have hoped for some respite after Kaur's dismissal, but Rodrigues joined Deol to add a further 116 runs in a little over 12 overs for the fourth wicket as India constructed a big total.\nRodrigues, who reached fifty off just 34 balls, was at her innovative best as she clobbered Connell for four boundaries in an over as India motored in the backend of the innings.\nDeol fell to Qiana soon but that had little impact on the proceedings.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/harleen-deols-ton-fuels-115-run-win-over-west-indies-as-india-clinch-odi-series-7324401", "authors": ["Press Trust of India"], "date_publish": "2024-12-12T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Harleen Deol underscored her growing maturity with an impressive maiden hundred, the foundation of Indias 115-run win over the West Indies in the second Womens ODI"}

{"title": "\"He Is The Best Batsman In The World\": Australia Great's Big Verdict On Travis Head", "text": "Travis Head is the \"best batter in the world\" whose performances against Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy exemplify his fearless approach and \"Australian way of batting\", feels legendary cricketer Greg Chappell. Head has dominated the batting chart with 409 runs in the first three Tests with two hundreds and a fifty, and former Australia captain Chappell believes his simplicity and aggression are behind his success as a Test batter. \"Head's performances against Jasprit Bumrah in this series exemplify his fearless approach. While most batsmen struggle to survive Bumrah's unorthodox action, sharp pace, and relentless accuracy, Head has treated him like any other bowler,\" Chappell wrote in Sydney Morning Herald.\n\"By playing with intent and looking to score off Bumrah, Head has not only nullified his threat but disrupted his rhythm. His ability to dispatch short deliveries with authority and drive fuller ones with precision has been remarkable, underscoring the strides he has made,\" he added.\nChappell said Head's flourish in the recent years across formats is due to an uncluttered mindset.\n\"From a raw, unpredictable talent to one of the most dominant male batters in world cricket, Travis Head has soared into his prime with an almost ethereal elegance,\" Chappell wrote.\n\"His story is not just about overcoming challenges but about embracing a simplicity of style that has become his hallmark — one that allows his mind to remain uncluttered and his game devastatingly effective,\" he added.\nChappell termed Head's 152 against England in the 2021-22 series as the \"turning point\".\n\"The turning point came during the 2021 Ashes. Head's counterattacking 152 in Brisbane was a revelation. Walking in at 5-195, he transformed the game with a whirlwind innings, taking the opposition bowlers apart and shifting the momentum firmly in Australia's favour,\" he wrote.\n\"That innings wasn't just about runs, it was a statement of intent, a declaration that he would play his way.\" Chappell believes Head is one of the most feared batters in the world who can dictate terms against the best bowlers.\n\"Since that series, Head has gone from strength to strength, evolving into one of the most feared batsmen in the world.\n\"His numbers since 2022 underline his dominance: 1800 runs at an average of 56.25, with six centuries at a strike rate of 75.6. These are not just impressive figures, they are a testament to his ability to thrive under pressure and dictate terms against the best bowlers in the world,\" Chappell added.\nChappell praised the 30-year-old left-handed batter for prioritising intent over caution.\nAdvertisement\n\"The essence of Travis Head's batting lies in his uncluttered mind. He has chosen a path that prioritises intent over caution, a mindset that allows him to approach every ball with the aim of scoring runs,\" he wrote.\n\"This doesn't mean recklessness – it's a calculated, efficient approach that keeps bowlers and captains under pressure. By getting into good positions to score, Head simultaneously positions himself to defend against the better deliveries. It's a virtuous cycle that rewards his positive intent,\" he added.\nChappell said Head's ability to strike balance between aggression and elegance are the qualities which also make him a captaincy candidate in future.\n\"What sets Head apart is his ability to blend aggression with elegance. He has always been a powerful player of cross-bat shots, but his recent improvement in driving full deliveries down the ground has elevated his game,\" he wrote.\n\"I believe Travis to be the most improved batter in world cricket in the past three years and in becoming so, has firmed in favouritism to be the next Australian captain.\n\"In his current form, Travis exemplifies the Australian way of batting, and I agree with Ricky Ponting and Ian Healy when they praise the way he is playing.\n\"Today, as the butterfly of his transformation soars, it's clear: Travis Head is the best batsman in the world.\"\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/he-is-the-best-batsman-in-the-world-australia-greats-big-verdict-on-travis-head-7327044", "authors": ["Press Trust of India"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Travis Head is the \"best batter in the world\" whose performances against Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy exemplify his fearless approach"}

Fakhar supported Babar after the former Pakistan skipper was dropped during the home Test series against England and even namedropped Kohli in his social media post. However, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was not pleased with the reaction and Fakhar was dropped from the central contracts list. During an interview with PAK TV, Fakhar said that he was not criticising PCB and added that he was merely expressing his own opinion.\n\"I thought about it later and felt that I should not have tweeted. But people got the tweet completely wrong. They thought that I was criticising the decision of the board, but this is 100 per cent wrong. If you see the timing of the tweet, it was done before the board made its decision. I saw in the news for 2-3 days that journalists and former players were criticising him (Babar Azam). And I thought to myself, Babar has done so much for the team, but they still wanted him to be dropped,\" Fakhar said in the interview.\n\"I saw that and tweeted my opinion out. But I understand that no one is bigger than the board.

{"title": "\"Kid In The Backyard...\": Pat Cummins' Hilarious Advice To 19-Year-Old Debutant Sam Konstas", "text": "Ahead of the fourth Test against India, Australian skipper Pat Cummins had a special message for the 19-year-old debutant Sam Kontas, urging the batter to enjoy being a part of the Boxing Day Test, and not overthink it. The U19 ICC World Cup winning star Konstas, having built heavy hype for himself following a string of powerful performances at the domestic level for New South Wales (NSW), will have a chance at justifying it as he takes on an Indian attack led by a world-class Jasprit Bumrah, which will no doubt be motivated to do better and take a 2-1 series lead after drawing the third Test at Brisbane from an almost unwinnable position. Speaking during the pre-match presser as quoted by cricket.com.au, Cummins reminisced about his international debut in November 2011 against South Africa, in which he took seven wickets across both innings including a six-wicket haul. Cummins said that even he was as excited as Konstas was before his debut. He also said that when players start, there is a \"level of naivety\" as they want to take the game on as if it Is \"backyard\" cricket.\n\"It was pretty awesome. I spent a bit of the time wondering why, or how, I was there and how it happened so quickly. I just remember being really excited,\" said Cummins.\n\"I think it is similar to Sammy (Konstas) this week. There is a level of naivety that you just want to go out and play like you do when you are a kid in the backyard. You just want to take the game on, have fun, and not overthink it.\"\n\"That is the message to Sam. That is definitely how I felt as an 18-year-old. I was just really excited, and once the game started, you go into game mode and it's just like any other game,\" he concluded his point.\nThe Aussie captain also hilariously recalled how as an 18-year-old, he felt that he had more leeway in case of a bad game and it was the selector's fault for selecting him at such a young age.\n\"I remember as an 18-year-old I was thinking, 'I have got a lot more leeway because I was young' - almost publicly - so I almost felt like, if I did not have a great game, it was not my fault - it was the selectors' fault for picking me,\" he said.\n\"I was like, 'well, they're the idiots that picked an 18-year-old!' You are so young starting out your career - it is Boxing Day, it does not get any better than this. So just enjoy the moment,\" he signed off.\nKonstas played a vital role in Australia's ICC U19 World Cup 2024 triumph, scoring 191 runs in seven innings at an average of 27.28, including a century. He also featured in a two-match series between Australia A and India A ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, scoring 92 runs in four innings, highlighted by a match-winning 73*. In the warm-up pink-ball game against India, he stamped his authority with a classy 107 off 97 balls against a formidable Indian attack.\nIn the ongoing Sheffield Shield season, Konstas is the fifth-highest run-getter with 471 runs in five matches at an average of 58.87, including two centuries and a fifty, with a best score of 152.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/kid-in-the-backyard-pat-cummins-hilarious-advice-to-19-year-old-debutant-sam-konstas-7326749", "authors": ["Asian News International"], "date_publish": "2024-12-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Ahead of the fourth Test against India, Australian skipper Pat Cummins had a special message for the 19-year-old debutant Sam Kontas, urging the batter to enjoy being a part of the Boxing Day Test, and not overthink it."}

However, Ashwin doesn't want people to celebrate his career or worship him. For him, the sport is above all individuals. However, the owner of 537 Test wickets said that he does want to burst a few cricketing myths. Former England captains Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain had a detailed virtual conversation with Ashwin, who is currently in Chennai following his retirement from international cricket.\nDuring the interaction, Ashwin gave some interesting insights into his memoir \"I Have The Streets: A Kutty Cricket Story\" which was released earlier this year in July. During the chat, Ashwin opened up on one of the biggest myths about him. He said that people think that he is too serious and doesn't enjoy the game as much as someone like Virat Kohli.\nHowever, Ashwin's insisted that's not the case, adding that he gets lost while playing cricket.\n\"I wanted people to know me for who I am, because a lot of times, Ashwin's picking up a wicket and Virat Kohli is all over the place. He's just jumping about and people very often tend to believe that Ashwin's the one that's absolutely serious and Virat's the one that's having all the fun, which is why somebody asked me the question, why are you serious all the time? My answer to that in the first place is I'm never a serious person, but when somebody is clobbering me and I have the ball in my hand to win a Test Match for my country, my mind is sticking, because I'm in the process. So very often, you don't see me picking up a five-wicket haul and pushing across a kiss through the blade of my bat to my better half sitting in the dressing room or sitting in the hospitality box. So I felt like a lot of who I am got diluted in the fact of what I've become. So I wanted to bring that out in my book,\" Ashwin said on Sky Sports.\nIndian cricket has been blessed to witness greats of the game like Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, who often get worshipped like gods.However, Ashwin feels it's harsh to sideline others as cricket is a team sport. But, for Ashwin, he has always been the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of his own story.\n\"A lot of people talk about, when they talk about Indian cricket, that's one thing I want to change over the years. They talk about Virat Kohli, they have been talking about Rohit over the years. When I grew up, I spoke a lot about Sachin, I spoke about other superstars, the celebrities. One message I would leave for everybody and I want to constantly change is that it's not the fact that these are glorious cricketers but people on the outside who believe that everyone plays a support cast are extremely wrong because this is a sport. An MVP in my life, for my dad or for my mom, I am the MVP. It's not Rohit, Virat or somebody on the outside, likewise, everyone's journey is unique.

Kambli (52) is responding to the treatment for urinary tract infections for which he was admitted at Akruti Hospital near Bhiwandi town on Saturday (December 21), Dr Vivek Trivedi told PTI. Trivedi is heading the medical team that is supervising the former cricketer's health. Doctors were planning to do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) on the former India batter, but since he has developed a fever, a decision on the non-invasive medical procedure will be taken later, he said. The MRI procedure has been necessitated after a series of medical examinations conducted earlier revealed clots in his brain, Trivedi said.\nKambli is likely to be shifted out of the ICU within a day or two and discharged after about four days, he said.\nHe said the condition of the Mumbai-based former cricketer was critical four days back when he had an extreme urinary infection as puss had got collected in his bladder.

Aggressive number five Head is the highest run scorer in the five-match series, plundering centuries at both Adelaide and Brisbane. He picked up a minor thigh strain at the Gabba and there were lingering concerns about his fitness, but skipper Pat Cummins said the left-hander was fine.\n\"Trav is good to go, so he will play. He just ticked off some final things today and yesterday,\" said Cummins. \"No stress, no worries about injury for Trav, so he will go into the game fully fit.\n\"I don't think you'll see too much management of him through the game.

With the series tied at 1-1 after three matches, this match is extremely important when it comes to the World Test Championship (WTC) Final dreams for both sides. Just after practice ended on Tuesday, a female fan repeatedly urged Rohit to call Shubman Gill and said that she was his fan. In a video by Revsportz, Rohit was seen gesturing towards the fan to come back later as Gill had already finished his training. However, the fan kept shouting for Gill prompting Rohit to respond loudly - “Kaha se lau?

{"title": "Greg Chappell Lauds Travid Heads Fearless Approach Against Jasprit Bumrah", "text": "Former Australian cricketer Greg Chappell has heaped praise on Travis Head for his audacious and effective approach against India's pace spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah, during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. In his column for The Sydney Morning Herald, Chappell highlighted Head's ability to not just survive against Bumrah but also counter-attack, disrupting the rhythm of one of the world's most formidable bowlers. Head's performances against Bumrah stand out in a series where many batters have struggled against the Ahmedabad-born pacer's unorthodox action, searing pace, and pinpoint accuracy. Bumrah has picked up 21 wickets in three Tests at a jaw-dropping average of 10.90. Despite Bumrah dismissing Head twice, the left-hander has managed to score 83 runs off him at an average of 41.5 and a blistering strike rate of 91.2.\nChappell emphasised Head's fearless intent and proactive mindset in his approach to tackling Bumrah. “Head's performances against Jasprit Bumrah in this series exemplify his fearless approach,” Chappell wrote.\n“While most batsmen struggle to survive Bumrah's unorthodox action, sharp pace, and relentless accuracy, Head has treated him like any other bowler. By playing with intent and looking to score off Bumrah, Head has not only nullified his threat but disrupted his rhythm.”\nChappell further praised Head's technical proficiency, especially his ability to dominate short-pitched deliveries and execute precision drives to fuller ones. “His ability to dispatch short deliveries with authority and drive fuller ones with precision has been remarkable, underscoring the strides he has made,” the former Indian head coach added.\nHead's fearless batting has been a key component in Australia's performances in the series. His quick-fire 140 in the pink-ball Test came when Australia were under pressure at 103/3, a knock that shifted the momentum back in their favour. In the third Test in Brisbane, Head's monumental 152 off 160 balls, which included a mammoth 241-run partnership with Steve Smith, further showcased his ability to dominate world-class bowlers in challenging conditions.\nBeyond his batting prowess, Chappell believes Head's consistency across formats and his temperament make him a strong contender to succeed Pat Cummins as Australia's captain. The 76-year-old wrote, “I believe Travis to be the most improved batter in world cricket in the past three years and in becoming so, has firmed in favouritism to be the next Australian captain. In his current form, Travis exemplifies the Australian way of batting.”\nChappell also aligned his views with those of former Australian players Ricky Ponting and Ian Healy, who have been vocal in their admiration for Head. “I couldn't take my eyes off the screen when he was batting in the Brisbane Test,” Chappell remarked.\nWith the series locked at 1-1, the upcoming Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, starting on Thursday will be pivotal for both teams.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/greg-chappell-lauds-travid-heads-fearless-approach-against-jasprit-bumrah-7324692", "authors": [], "date_publish": "2024-11-25T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Chappell emphasised Heads fearless intent and proactive mindset in his approach to tackling Bumrah"}

The victory also propelled India to an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Deol (115, 103b, 16x4) powered India's record-equalling 358 for five and she received ample support from Pratika Rawal (76, 86b, 10x4, 1x6), Smriti Mandhana (53, 47b, 7x4, 2x6) and Jemimah Rodrigues (52, 36b, 6x4, 1x6).\nThe task of chasing 359 was always going to be out of Windies' reach, and they were bowled out for 243 despite skipper Hayley Matthews making a flowing hundred (106, 109b, 13x4).\nThe writing on the wall was clear once the Indian bowlers reduced Windies to 69 for four inside the first 20 overs.\nBut Matthews added 112 runs for the fifth wicket with Shemaine Campbelle (38) to delay the inevitable.\nMatthews, who reached her seventh ODI hundred in 99 balls, stood out for the power and precision until she fell to off-spinner Rawal.\nThe Indian bowlers also deserve a good chunk of credit for sticking to good lines on a slightly spongy wicket.\nThey attacked the stumps regularly and leg-spinner Priya Mishra was splendid while mixing up leg-breaks and googles without any visible change in action.\nApart from Priya (3/49), pacer Titas Sadhu (2/42) and seasoned spinner Deepti Sharma (2/40) were the pick of Indian bowlers.\nEarlier, Deol's impressive coming-of-age hundred powered India's batting effort that saw them equalling their highest-ever ODI total, which was also the highest total any team has made against the Caribbeans.\nThe Indian management will be mighty pleased by Deol's hundred as she marked her growth as an all-field player from a predominantly off-side batter during this knock.\nNot precisely a power-hitter, the right-hander has added more nuances to her batting through the ability to find angles and gaps.\nAdvertisement\nIt was evident when she peppered Deandra Dottin for three fours through fine leg, point and behind point to move into the 90s.\nHer 100 came along with a nicely-timed boundary off pacer Shamilia Connell in 98 balls.\nBut for an imposing total, India should also thank Mandhana and Rawal for adding 110 runs off the opening wicket in just 16.3 overs, their second successive 100-run partnership in ODIs.\nThey looked hardly in any trouble until some lethargic running between the wicket resulted in Mandhana's run out.\nRawal, who raised her maiden ODI fifty in 58 balls, looked well settled for a hundred in only her second 50-over game, but the right-hander failed to negotiate Zaida James' delivery with a bit of extra bounce, scooping it to Qiana Joseph at short mid-wicket.\nShe added 62 runs for the second wicket with Deol.\nSkipper Harmanpreet Kaur could not produce a big one, getting bowled in her attempt to slog sweep Afy Fletcher's full-length delivery.\nWest Indies might have hoped for some respite after Kaur's dismissal, but Rodrigues joined Deol to add a further 116 runs in a little over 12 overs for the fourth wicket as India constructed a big total.\nRodrigues, who reached fifty off just 34 balls, was at her innovative best as she clobbered Connell for four boundaries in an over as India motored in the backend of the innings.\nDeol fell to Qiana soon but that had little impact on the proceedings.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/harleen-deols-ton-fuels-115-run-win-over-west-indies-as-india-clinch-odi-series-7324401", "authors": ["Press Trust of India"], "date_publish": "2024-12-12T00:00:00", "language": "en", "description": "Harleen Deol underscored her growing maturity with an impressive maiden hundred, the foundation of Indias 115-run win over the West Indies in the second Womens ODI"}

Shastri delved into the fluctuating fortunes of these players in the longest format of the game and emphasised the resilience and hunger that still make Kohli and Smith dangerous opponents. While Root and Williamson have enjoyed a phenomenal 2024, scoring six and four Test centuries respectively, Kohli and Smith have managed only one each—both coming during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Root's prolific run in particular has solidified his place as one of the most consistent batters in modern cricket, while Williamson continues to exude elegance and composure at the crease.\n\"I think they (Kohli and Smith) will have slipped down the ranks on current form because you know you've got the likes of Root taking off, there's Williamson doing well, Harry Brook has come onto the scene, you know there are a lot of other young players pushing but these are class players,\" Shastri told The ICC Review.\n\"In a situation like this, you know they'll be dangerous because they'll be hungry,\" he added.\nOn the other hand, Kohli and Smith have faced challenges this year, finding themselves outscored by emerging talents like Harry Brook. However, both experienced campaigners have shown flashes of brilliance, reminding the cricketing world why they remain among the best.\nShastri highlighted Smith's resilience, referring to his determined innings at the Gabba against India, where the Australian maestro scored his 33rd Test century.\n\"What's needed you saw from Smith. It might have been a struggle early on but he was prepared to play the waiting game and be disciplined,” Shastri noted.\nShastri remains confident that Kohli, too, has the ability to regain his peak form. According to Shastri, Kohli's form isn't the issue; instead, it's about surviving the critical early phase of his innings.\n\"I think the same with Virat,” Shastri added. “If Virat gets over that first 30, 40 minutes, with serious application and discipline, I don't think he's (out of form), none of these guys are out of form.”\nFor Shastri, what separates great players from the rest is their hunger to succeed even during lean patches.

Barring Kohli's unbeaten century in the second innings of the first Test at Perth, the 36-year old has struggled with the bat and has constantly been caught with the ball outside the off-stump. Hayden believes the track at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the venue for the Boxing Day Test, will be suitable for batters and backs the Indian great to come back to form if he can resist the urge to slash at the ball outside the off-stump.\n\"There could have been magnificent wins, there could have been losses, there could have been spinning conditions—I mean, you can list off a hundred different areas where Virat Kohli, over his magnificent career, would have batted. But in Melbourne, he's going to have a good batting track. What he does need to do is find a way to continue staying at the crease. Flashing outside the off-stump is something that he's going to have to resist,” said Hayden to Star Sports.\nHayden went on to recall one of the greatest Test innings played by Sachin when the fiery Australian bowling attack of Brett Lee, Andy Bichel, and Jason Gillespie targeted the same areas in hopes of finding the outside edge. What followed was an incredible display of resilience as the ‘Master Blaster' went on to score an unbeaten 241, an innings laced with 33 boundaries but none of them came in the cover region.\n“And I suggest - he gets in line with the ball a bit more and looks to play down the ground a little bit more... I know he's a magnificent cover driver, but so was Sachin Tendulkar, and he put it away for a day. I sat in the gully licking my lips, thinking, you know what, this is magnificent, stubborn batting. I didn't look like getting a catch that day, and yet I felt like I was in the game that entire series.\n“Sachin put away the cover drive, worked his way into the innings, hit off his legs beautifully, took on the spin, and addressed the areas of concern. He put a big cross through them and said, ‘Not on my watch today.' Virat Kohli has got that personality, and I'm sure we'll see it in Melbourne,” he added.\nThe ongoing BGT is perfectly poised for a blockbuster finish with India and Australia tied at 1-1.

The co-founders, CEO Cristian Ponce and the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Théo Schäfer, brought the startup out of stealth in November after a successful seed round funding. The company aims to build intelligent software that can be integrated with lab robotics to automate the entire process of scientific discovery and invention, right from creating a hypothesis to running experiments, and drawing conclusions.\nBuilding AI-Powered Robotics Scientists\nFounded in 2023, the startup was working in stealth for the last year-and-a-half to build its first product — an AI scientist that can run experiments. It is now out of stealth and is currently working with La Jolla Labs in RNA therapeutic drug development. On its website, the startup has detailed its vision and the first product it is working on. Notably, it does not have any products in the public domain yet.\nHighlighting the problem statement it aims to solve, the startup says that automation in science is focused on high volume of experiments instead of a high variety. This is because lab robots currently require extensive programming to replicate specific protocols. However, this has led to creation of a system that creates assembly lines instead of robots that can be assistant to scientists, the company said.\nTetsuwan Scientific stated that the problem is that robots cannot understand the scientific intent, and thus, cannot carry out an experiment on its own. However, looking at generative AI models, the company says, it is now possible to bridge this communication gap and teach robots how to act like a scientist. It is a two-pronged problem that requires an intelligent software combined with a versatile robotics hardware.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Ponce highlighted that large language models (LLMs) can bridge the software gap by allowing developers to communicate scientific intent to a robot without the requirement of writing thousands of lines of code. The CEO highlighted that the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework can also help in keeping AI hallucination down.\nAs per the publication, Tetsuwan Scientific is building non-humanoid robots. These robots, also showcased on the website, are large square shaped glass-like structure that are said to evaluate results and make changes to scientific experiments without requiring human intervention. These robots are said to be powered by AI software and sensors to gain knowledge about technical standards such as calibration, liquid class characterisation, and other properties.\nNotably, the startup is currently in the initial stages towards its ultimate goal of building independent robotic AI scientists that can automate the entire scientific process and invent things.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/ai/news/tetsuwan-scientific-ai-robotic-scientists-experiments-inventions-7323374", "authors": ["Akash Dutta", "Manas Mitul"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T19:28:12", "language": "en", "description": "Tetsuwan Scientific, a San Francisco-based startup, is building artificial intelligence (AI) robotics that can perform the tasks of a scientist."}

{"title": "Honda Crafts Nissan Rescue Plan That Plays Out Over Years", "text": "Honda Motor sketched plans for a drawn-out deal that amounts to an acquisition of Nissan Motor, as Japan's automakers struggle to keep up in an increasingly competitive global car industry.\nThe two announced a tentative agreement Monday to set up a joint holding company that will aim to list shares in August 2026. While their executives called the transaction a merger, Honda will take the lead in forming the new entity and nominate a majority of its directors. Nissan's partner Mitsubishi Motors may also participate in the deal.\nNissan's shares fell as much as 7.3 percent at the market open in Tokyo on Tuesday. Honda rose 14.4 percent.\n“On the face of it, it's a takeover,” said Neal Ganguli, a partner and managing director at advisory firm AlixPartners' automotive and industrial practice. “Scale definitely has advantages, and folks are going to have to take notice.”\nHonda and Nissan both are having trouble contending with ascendant domestic automakers in China, which surpassed Japan as the world's largest car-exporting nation last year and is pulling further ahead in 2024. Honda Chief Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe spoke to the level of difficulty ahead for the companies when he said during a press conference that their goal is to be competitive by 2030.\n“Honda and Nissan merger synergies will take time to emerge if a deal is concluded in 2025,” Tatsuo Yoshida, a senior industry analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note. “Nissan may get relief from its financial strain, while Honda's near-term benefits may be limited.”\nHonda did offer something of a sweetener for its shareholders, announcing plans to buy back as much as JPY 1.1 trillion ($7 billion or roughly Rs. 59,632 crore) of its stock by this time next year. The upper limit of the buyback amounts to 24 percent of issued shares.\nA rescue by Honda would avert total disaster for Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, whose standings have deteriorated since the arrest of their former Chairman Carlos Ghosn in November 2018. Just over a year after Nissan accused its longtime leader of financial misconduct, he fled Japan for Lebanon.\nGhosn, 70, has denied all charges and alleged Nissan defamed him.\nMitsubishi Motors, which is 24.5 percent owned by Nissan, signed a preliminary agreement to explore joining the deal with Honda, saying it expects to firm up the decision by the end of January.\nHonda's stock closed up 3.8 percent on Monday in Tokyo, recouping much of its loss since the deal talks were first reported last week. Shares of Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors rose 1.6 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively.\nCombining the three companies would create one of the world's largest carmakers, though the group would still be smaller than Japan's Toyota Motor Joining forces also could bolster their efforts to ward off Chinese manufacturers led by BYD, which is now among the world's leading electric-vehicle manufacturers.\nNissan's biggest shareholder, France's Renault SA, acknowledged its longtime alliance partner's announcement, saying the talks with Honda were still at an early stage.\nRenault, which owns 36 percent of Nissan, also said in a statement that it will consider all options and continue executing its strategy, which includes joint projects with Nissan.\nHonda's CEO Mibe said combining with Nissan would generate billions of yen in incremental operating profit, though he didn't offer timelines. The 63-year-old executive also didn't address how the companies would deal with pressing issues such as closing factories.\n“Both companies will continue as wholly owned subsidiaries of the joint holding company with their respective brands in place,” Mibe said.\nHonda's share buyback supersedes a previously announced plan to repurchase ¥100 billion worth of stock from Nov. 7 of this year through October 2025. The large buyback is being launched now because Honda's ability to repurchase shares is expected to be restricted during the lead-up to the deal the companies aim to close in 2026.\nNissan has withered in the years since Ghosn's ouster, squandering its position as an early contender in the shift to fully electric vehicles.\nIn China, the soaring popularity of locally made EVs has left some foreign brands fighting for survival. Honda and Nissan both have had to pare back staffing and production, while Mitsubishi Motors has all but pulled out of the world's biggest car market.\nNissan also has been on the back foot amid a resurgence in popularity of gas-electric hybrid cars in the US. While Toyota dominates the powertrain segment, Honda is relatively well positioned and could provide a welcome boost.\nThe combination of falling sales in the US and China has been devastating for Nissan, leading the company to cut thousands of jobs, slash production capacity and lower its annual profit outlook by 70 percent.\n“Partnering with Honda isn't a sign that we're giving up on our plans to turn Nissan around,” Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida said Monday.\nNissan was rescued from its last financial crisis more than two decades ago, when Renault swooped in with a cash injection and dispatched Ghosn to orchestrate a turnaround. The exiled executive weighed in on the deal talks from Beirut, telling Bloomberg Television last week that Nissan is in “panic mode.”\nSpeaking to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan via teleconference on Monday, Ghosn pointed out that Nissan's unit sales have fallen more than 40 percent since 2018 and the carmaker is barely breaking even.\nNissan's Uchida and Honda's Mibe said they didn't know anything about Hon Hai Precision Co., the Taiwan-based iPhone maker known as Foxconn, having interest in taking over Nissan.\nPeople familiar with the matter said last week that Foxconn sent a delegation to meet with Renault in France. However, Foxconn has put its interest in pursuing Nissan on hold while negotiations with Honda play out, one person said.\n© 2024 Bloomberg LP", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/auto/news/honda-nissan-rescue-plan-plays-over-year-7321849", "authors": ["Nicholas Takahashi and Tsuyoshi Inajima, Bloomberg News"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T16:02:46", "language": "en", "description": "Honda and Nissan both are having trouble contending with ascendant domestic automakers in China."}

{"title": "Hugging Face Showcases How Test-Time Compute Scaling Can Help SLMs Outperform Larger AI Models", "text": "Hugging Face shared a new case study last week showcasing how small language models (SLMs) can outperform larger models. In the post, the platform's researchers claimed that instead of increasing the training time of artificial intelligence (AI) models, focusing on the test-time compute can show enhanced results for AI models. The latter is an inference strategy that allows AI models to spend more time on solving a problem and offers different approaches such as self-refinement and searching against a verifier that can improve their efficiency.\nHow Test-Time Compute Scaling Works\nIn a post, Hugging Face highlighted that the traditional approach to improving the capabilities of an AI model can often be resource-intensive and extremely expensive. Typically, a technique dubbed train-time compute is used where the pretraining data and algorithms are used to improve the way a foundation model breaks down a query and gets to the solution.\nAlternatively, the researchers claimed that focusing on test-time compute scaling, a technique where AI models are allowed to spend more time solving a problem and letting them correct themselves can show similar results.\nHighlighting the example of OpenAI's o1 reasoning-focused model, which uses test-time compute, the researchers stated that this technique can let AI models display enhanced capabilities despite making no changes to the training data or pretraining methods. However, there was one problem. Since most reasoning models are closed, there is no way to know the strategies that are being used.\nThe researchers used a study by Google DeepMind and reverse engineering techniques to unravel how exactly LLM developers can scale test-time compute in the post-training phase. As per the case study, just increasing the processing time does not show significant improvement in outputs for complex queries.\nInstead, the researchers recommend using a self-refinement algorithm that allows AI models to assess the responses in subsequent iterations and identify and correct potential errors. Additionally, using a verifier that models can search against can further improve the responses.

{"title": "MIT Researchers Measure Quantum Geometry of Electrons in Solid Materials for First Time", "text": "A new study has allowed physicists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and collaborators to measure the quantum geometry of electrons in solids. The research provides insights into the shape and behaviour of electrons within crystalline materials at a quantum level. Quantum geometry, which had previously been limited to theoretical predictions, has now been directly observed, enabling unprecedented avenues for manipulating quantum material properties, according to the study.\nNew Pathways for Quantum Material Research\nThe study was published in Nature Physics on November 25. As described by Riccardo Comin, Class of 1947 Career Development Associate Professor of Physics at MIT, the achievement is a major advancement in quantum material science. In an interview with MIT's Materials Research Laboratory, Comin highlighted that their team has developed a blueprint for obtaining completely new information about quantum systems. The methodology used can potentially be applied to a wide range of quantum materials beyond the one tested in this study.\nTechnical Innovations Enable Direct Measurement\nThe research employed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), a technique previously used by Comin and his colleagues to examine quantum properties. The team adapted ARPES to directly measure quantum geometry in a material known as kagome metal, which features a lattice structure with unique electronic properties. Mingu Kang, first author of the paper and a Kavli Postdoctoral Fellow at Cornell University, noted that this measurement became possible due to collaboration between experimentalists and theorists from multiple institutions, including South Korea during the pandemic.\nThese experiences underscore the collaborative and resourceful efforts involved in realising this scientific breakthrough.

{"title": "Flamanville 3 Nuclear Reactor Begins Operations After Long Delays in France", "text": "France's nuclear energy sector reached a significant milestone as the Flamanville 3 European Pressurised Reactor in Normandy was successfully connected to the national electricity grid. According to reports, this reactor, now the country's most powerful with a capacity of 1,600 MW, began supplying electricity at 11:48 am local time on Saturday. Officials from EDF, the state-owned energy firm, highlighted to the media that the connection marks an important chapter in the nation's energy strategy, despite facing years of technical issues, delays, and cost overruns.\nDecades in the Making\nThe Flamanville 3 project, initiated in 2007, was designed to revive interest in nuclear energy across Europe following past disasters. Reports have indicated that its advanced pressurised water reactor technology offers increased efficiency and improved safety measures. EDF's CEO, Luc Rémont, called the development “historic,” noting that it was the first new reactor to begin operations in France in 25 years. Challenges during the reactor's construction phase extended its timeline to 17 years, with costs escalating from an initial €3.3 billion to an estimated €13.2 billion.\nTesting Phase and Future Plans\nAs per reports, it has been confirmed by EDF that Flamanville 3 will undergo extensive testing at varying power levels until summer 2025. A full inspection, lasting approximately 250 days, is expected to occur in spring 2026. The facility is projected to supply power to over two million homes once fully operational.

{"title": "Scientists Demonstrate Negative Time in Quantum Experiments at Toronto Lab", "text": "A new study conducted at the University of Toronto has showcased experimental evidence of “negative time” in the quantum realm. While this concept has intrigued scientists for years, it has primarily been dismissed as a theoretical anomaly. The findings, which remain unpublished in a peer-reviewed journal, have sparked significant attention within the global scientific community after being shared on the preprint server arXiv. Researchers have clarified that this phenomenon, while perplexing, does not alter the broader understanding of time but instead highlights the peculiarities of quantum mechanics.\nInsights Into the Experiment\nLed by Daniela Angulo, an experimental physicist at the University of Toronto, the research team focused on interactions between light and matter. By measuring the behaviour of photons as they passed through atoms, the scientists observed that the atoms entered a higher-energy state, only to return to their normal state almost instantaneously. This change in energy duration was quantified, revealing a negative time interval.\nAephraim Steinberg, a professor of experimental quantum physics at the university, explained during a press interaction that while the findings might suggest particles travel back in time, this interpretation would be incorrect. Instead, the results demonstrate the probabilistic behaviour of quantum particles, which challenges traditional understandings of time.\nScientific and Public Reactions\nThis discovery has drawn both fascination and scepticism. Prominent physicist Sabine Hossenfelder criticised the interpretation in a widely-viewed video, asserting that the phenomenon described relates to photon travel and phase shifts rather than the passage of time. In response, the researchers emphasised the importance of exploring the complexities of quantum mechanics to better understand anomalies like these.\nSteinberg acknowledged the controversy surrounding their approach but defended their interpretation of the results. He stated, according to reports, that while immediate practical applications are not apparent, the research could open doors to further investigation of quantum phenomena.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/scientists-demonstrate-negative-time-in-quantum-experiments-at-toronto-lab-7313882", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T19:00:01", "language": "en", "description": "University of Toronto scientists uncover \"negative time\" through quantum experiments, redefining photon behaviour"}
{"title": "Robot Replicates Traditional Chinese Massage for Therapy and Wellness", "text": "A robotic system capable of replicating traditional Chinese massage techniques has been developed by researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology. According to a paper on the arXiv preprint server, this technology incorporates traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) principles and could find applications in health care, rehabilitation, and wellness. Designed to assist patients with various types of discomfort, the robot may offer a safe and controlled alternative to human-administered massages.\nSystem Features and Capabilities\nAccording to reports, the robotic system features two jaka zhu7 robotic arms, each fitted with multi-functional massage hands closely resembling human hands in shape and size. These hands operate in four modes, which mimic TCM massage techniques, as noted in the study. The modes include palm-punching, vibrating, kneading, and finger techniques, which are based on ancient principles involving zang-fu organs and meridians.\nAccording to the statement made by the research team led by Yuan Xu, Kui Huang, Weichao Guo, and Leyi Du, the system utilises an adaptive admittance control algorithm for optimised force and position control. This technology ensures the safety and comfort of users by accounting for differences in muscle stiffness and posture changes during massages.\nTechnique Replication and Testing\nThe development process involved collecting data from TCM experts using motion capture and strength measurement systems. The captured data was used to train machine learning algorithms to replicate massage techniques accurately. As per the research, the robot successfully demonstrated its ability to replicate four massage techniques: beat, press, push, and vibrate.\nFuture Prospects\nThe team plans to refine the robotic system further and test its effectiveness in clinical settings. Potential improvements could expand its capabilities to include additional massage styles, enhancing its utility in therapeutic and wellness applications. Researchers hope this innovation will inspire further advancements in automated therapeutic technologies.\nSources indicate that this development marks a significant step in integrating traditional practices with modern robotics, presenting new possibilities for assistive health care solutions.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/robot-replicates-traditional-chinese-massage-for-therapy-and-wellness-7313759", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T18:00:01", "language": "en", "description": "Robotic system developed to replicate Chinese massage techniques for therapeutic use in health and wellness"}

Jesse Pollak, a senior Coinbase official, shares this sentiment, describing Indian developers in the fields of crypto, DeFi, and blockchain applications as highly ‘sophisticated' in their understanding and innovation with distributed ledger technology (DLT). As the creator of Coinbase's Layer-2 blockchain, ‘Base,' and the lead for Coinbase Wallet services, Pollak brings a wealth of expertise to these observations.\nIn December, Bengaluru hosted the second edition of India Blockchain Week, celebrating the industry's achievements in 2024. The event united Web3 investors, developers, and community members to address existing challenges and outline focus areas for growth as the sector prepares for 2025. During the event, Jesse Pollak spoke with Gadgets 360, sharing insights on the roadmap for Coinbase's Base blockchain and his observations on India's evolving Web3 landscape.\nPollak had visited India earlier in November, traveling to Bengaluru—often referred to as India's Silicon Valley—to engage directly with Web3 builders. Reflecting on these interactions, he highlighted the exceptional skills and technical expertise of Indian blockchain developers, which stood out during his on-ground meetings.\nPollak's Observations on India's Web3 Market\n“Indian builders are sophisticated and passionate about contributing to the global on-chain economy. learned a lot from interacting on the ground with builders in Bengaluru,” Pollak told Gadgets 360.\nDuring the discussions, Pollak noted that India's Web3 sector faces a significant challenge beyond regulatory delays: the limited availability of borrowing and credit facilities.\nThis challenge stems from the strained relationship Indian banks have had with the crypto sector in recent years. In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), skeptical of cryptocurrencies, prohibited banks from offering services to crypto firms. However, in 2020, the Supreme Court of India overturned this ban, paving the way for renewed interaction. Despite this, Indian banks continue to grapple with defining their stance and engagement with the Web3 industry.\nICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Yes Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, and IDFC First Bank reportedly offer crypto buying, selling, and storage services alongside customer awareness and education services. The trend of banks issuing loans against crypto assets as collateral is still not as popular among traditional financial institutions.\n“There is a huge opportunity for on-chain micro-lending and credit. Tokenisation of assets, on-chain identity credentials, and updating legacy systems can help bring this to reality. Another massive opportunity is cross-border payments. While traditional finance, international payments across borders can take days and be prohibitively expensive, onchain cross-border payments operate 24/7,” Pollak noted.\nCurrently, a significant portion of Web3 startups in India depend on funding from venture capitalists and alternative sources.\nPollak's Vision for Base Blockchain\nAfter thorough testing, Coinbase officially made its Base blockchain live in August 2023. The Layer-2 blockchain is built atop the Ethereum blockchain. As per its official website, Base aims to keep gas fees under 1 cent (roughly Rs. 0.002519) while also maintaining the transaction speed at under a second.\nDiscussing the future of Base, Pollak emphasised his commitment to transitioning the currently centralised blockchain toward greater decentralisation.\n“Base benefits in many ways from our relationship with Coinbase. At the same time, we believe that Base must be decentralised, because decentralisation will help enable a global, open, on-chain economy that will unlock economic freedom around the world,” Pollak said.\nTwo key areas of focus in 2025 will be to make wallets easier and more accessible while also bringing more currencies on-chain, Pollak noted.\n“In 2025, we're focusing on making getting on-chain with a wallet dead simple. We want anyone --even people who have no experience on-chain -- to be able to get started in seconds. Secondly, stablecoins are key to the global on-chain economy. But to bring the world on-chain, it's crucial for people to be able to interact in their local currency. By 2026, we want to bring over 100 local currencies on Base,” the blockchain creator added.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/cryptocurrency/news/india-pro-crypto-banking-facilities-roadmap-base-blockchain-interview-coinbase-jesse-pollak-7321297", "authors": ["Radhika Parashar", "Siddharth Suvarna"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T14:45:49", "language": "en", "description": "Currently, a significant portion of Web3 startups in India depend on funding from venture capitalists and alternative sources."}
{"title": "The Star of Bethlehem: Astronomical and Religious Mystery Explained", "text": "The Star of Bethlehem, referenced in the Gospel of Matthew, has intrigued scholars, scientists, and theologians for centuries. According to reports, this celestial object is said to have guided the Magi—wise men from the East—to the birthplace of Jesus over 2,000 years ago. While the event is deeply rooted in Christian tradition, debates persist regarding its historical and scientific basis. Various theories suggest it could have been a natural astronomical phenomenon, an astrological interpretation, or even a symbolic narrative.\nAstronomical Possibilities Ruled Out\nAs per a report by The Conversation, studies have dismissed the possibility of the Star being a comet, such as Halley's Comet, which was visible in 11 B.C. Experts, including David Weintraub, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Vanderbilt University, told the publication that comets were historically seen as omens of disaster, making them unlikely candidates. Similarly, novas and supernovas have been ruled out due to the absence of corresponding astronomical remnants. Weintraub explained to All About Space that stars and celestial events would not have provided a fixed directional guide as described in the Gospel.\nAstrological Interpretations Considered\nTheories suggest the Magi, possibly astrologers from Babylon, interpreted a specific celestial alignment as a sign of significance. Sources indicate that on April 17, 6 B.C., a conjunction involving Jupiter and the moon in Aries may have been seen as symbolising the birth of a king. Professor Grant Mathews of the University of Notre Dame highlighted astrology's importance during that era, suggesting the alignment could have held astrological significance.\nConjunction Theories Gain Ground", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/the-star-of-bethlehem-astronomical-or-religious-mystery-explained-7313713", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T17:00:01", "language": "en", "description": "Explore theories on the Star of Bethlehem’s true nature, from astronomy to astrology"}
{"title": "ISRO and NASA to Launch NISAR Satellite in March 2025 for Earth Observation", "text": "American space agency NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) are scheduled to launch the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite in March 2025, as per multiple reports. The mission, estimated at Rs. 5,000 crore, aims to advance Earth observation capabilities globally. Reports indicate that the satellite, weighing 2.8 tonnes, will track planetary changes with precision and will scan nearly all of Earth's land and ice surfaces every 12 days. Its dual-frequency radar technology is expected to deliver unprecedented data accuracy.\nMission Features Advanced Radar Technology\nThe NISAR satellite incorporates synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology, enabling it to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or lighting. According to the official blog of NASA, its radar can detect surface changes as small as one inch and penetrate dense vegetation, making it a vital tool for mapping ecosystems and monitoring land dynamics. The dual-frequency radar combines NASA's L-band and ISRO's S-band, offering enhanced precision in data collection.\nLaunch and Operational Details\nAs per reports, ISRO's GSLV Mk-II rocket might carry the NISAR satellite into a sun-synchronous orbit from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. Positioned at an altitude of 747 km, the satellite is expected to operate for three years, observing Earth's landforms, ice formations, and vegetation changes. It will also assist in monitoring natural events such as earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic activity.\nChallenges Addressed Before the Launch\nThe report further mentions that the mission faced delays due to technical challenges involving its radar antenna reflector. To address these, reflective tape was added to manage temperature fluctuations. Key components of the satellite were transported from the United States to India in October 2024, completing a complex logistical process.\nImpact of NISAR's Observations\nAccording to experts, the mission's data will be instrumental in understanding solid Earth movements, their implications, and global environmental changes. Its wide-ranging applications include studying ecosystems, ice dynamics, and geological events, contributing significantly to research and disaster management efforts.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/isro-nasa-nisar-mission-to-launch-in-march-2025-for-earth-observation-7313615", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T16:00:01", "language": "en", "description": "ISRO and Nasa’s NISAR satellite set to launch in March 2025 for Earth observation"}

{"title": "NASA's Dawn Mission Unveils Insights into Vesta’s Mysterious Gullies Using Lab Simulations", "text": "NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which orbited the asteroid Vesta in 2012, captured images of mysterious gullies on its surface, raising questions about their origins. The asteroid, known for its craters, also features channels that seem to contradict the harsh vacuum conditions of space. According to a study, researchers have proposed that brief liquid flows, possibly resulting from briny water, might explain these formations. Lab experiments have been conducted to simulate the conditions, shedding light on a process previously unconfirmed.\nSimulating Vesta's Environment\nThe study was published in the Planetary Science Journal. As per the official blog of NASA, researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) used the Dirty Under-vacuum Simulation Testbed for Icy Environments (DUSTIE) to replicate conditions on Vesta following meteoroid impacts. These experiments revealed that while pure water freezes almost instantly in vacuum conditions, salty liquids remain fluid for longer periods. Lead author Michael J. Poston of the Southwest Research Institute noted in a statement that briny solutions could remain liquid for up to an hour, sufficient to create the observed gullies.\nBrine Deposits as a Key Factor\nThe study explored the possibility that impacts on Vesta exposed subsurface brine, causing temporary flows before freezing. According to Jennifer Scully, planetary scientist at JPL, in a statement, impacts could trigger the release of liquid, which would remain active long enough to carve surface features. Speaking to reporters, Scully highlighted that frozen \"lids\" formed on brines stabilised the liquid beneath, enabling it to flow for extended periods.\nInsights Beyond Vesta\nThe findings align with observations of other celestial bodies, such as Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa, where similar processes might occur. The research also builds on discoveries made during the Dawn mission, which indicated the presence of brines on Ceres, another body in the asteroid belt. While frozen brine on Vesta has yet to be confirmed, these experiments suggest new possibilities for understanding the geologic activity on airless worlds.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/nasas-dawn-mission-investigates-gullies-on-asteroid-vesta-using-lab-experiments-7313481", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T14:00:01", "language": "en", "description": "NASA’s experiments simulate Vesta's conditions, revealing how water may carve gullies on the asteroid"}

The Phi-3.5 series of small language models (SLMs), comprising Phi-3.5 Mixture of Experts (MoE), Phi-3.5 Mini, and Phi-3.5 Vision, was released in August. The open-source AI models were made available on Hugging Face. Instead of being typical conversational models, these were instruct models that require users to input specific instructions to get the desired output.\nMediaTek Optimises Dimensity Chipsets for Phi-3.5 SLMs\nIn a blog post, MediaTek announced that its Dimenisty 9400, Dimensity 9300, and Dimensity 8300 chipsets are now optimised for the Phi-3.5 AI models. With this, these mobile platforms can efficiently process and run inference for on-device generative AI tasks using MediaTek's neural processing units (NPUs).\nOptimising a chipset for a specific AI model involves tailoring the hardware design, architecture, and operation of the chipset to efficiently support the processing power, memory access patterns, and data flow of that particular model. After optimising, the AI model will show reduced latency and power consumption, and increased throughput.\nMediaTek highlighted that its processors are not only optimised for Microsoft's Phi-3.5 MoE but also for Phi-3.5 Mini which offers multi-lingual support and Phi-3.5 Vision which comes with multi-frame image understanding and reasoning.\nNotably, the Phi-3.5 MoE has 16x3.8 billion parameters. However, only 6.6 billion of them are active parameters when using two experts (typical use case). On the other hand, Phi-3.5 features 4.2 billion parameters and an image encoder, and the Phi-3.5 Mini has 3.8 billion parameters.\nComing to performance, Microsoft claimed that the Phi-3.5 MoE outperformed both Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o mini AI models on the SQuALITY benchmark which tests readability and accuracy when summarising a block of text.\nWhile developers can leverage Microsoft Phi-3.5 directly via Hugging Face or the Azure AI Model Catalogue, MediaTek's NeuroPilot SDK toolkit also offers access to these SLMs. The chip maker stated that the latter will enable developers to build optimised on-device applications capable of generative AI inference using the AI models across the above mentioned mobile platforms.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/ai/news/mediatek-dimensity-chipsets-optimisation-microsoft-phi-3-5-ai-models-7320712", "authors": ["Akash Dutta", "Siddharth Suvarna"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T13:40:29", "language": "en", "description": "MediaTek announced on Monday that it has now optimised several of its mobile platforms for Microsoft’s Phi-3.5 artificial intelligence (AI) models."}
{"title": "TRAI Mandates Telecom Operators to Offer Specialised Voice and SMS Packs, Benefitting Consumers in Rural Areas", "text": "The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued the twelfth amendment to the Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations on Monday. This mandates telecommunications operators in India to offer specialised recharge vouchers with select services that concerned stakeholders require. Notably, this announcement comes after the government's telecom watchdog held an open house discussion with concerned stakeholders in October, addressing issues such as choice of tariff availability, validity of vouchers, and colour coding of vouchers.\nTRAI's new regulations mandate telecom operators to offer standalone Special Tariff Vouchers (STVs) specifically for voice and SMS services. This move will give consumers an option to pay for the services that they require. As per the watchdog, its twelfth amendment will benefit consumers from certain segments, such as senior citizens and those residing in rural areas.\nIt also extends the validity period of STV and Combo Vouchers (CV) to 365 days, compared to the previous cap of just 90 days to benefit consumers, enabling them to opt for long-term plans.\nAs per the notice, the government watchdog is doing away with the requirement of colour-coded vouchers in favour of online recharges. Further, it also lifts the reservation on top-up voucher denominations, which were previously restricted to denominations of Rs. 10. Telecom operators can now offer vouchers as per their own denomination choices. However, they are still required to provide at least one top-up voucher of Rs. 10 denomination.\nTRAI says amendments have been made in definitions of STV and CV in the Telecommunication Tariff Order (1999) to align with the amendments made in the Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations.\nOther Recent Changes\nTRAI has enforced several guidelines in recent months. In August, the telecom watchdog issued a directive to all network providers, asking them to stop promotional calls from unregistered callers.

As per the report, the Redmond-based tech giant is trying to reduce its dependence on OpenAI's AI models due to concerns regarding speed and cost. To diversify, the company is said to be looking at both third-party models as well as internally developed models. Notably, Microsoft introduced 365 Copilot in March 2023 and one of its unique selling points (USP) was integration with the GPT-4 AI model.\nMicrosoft Aims to Reduce Reliance on OpenAI AI Model\nAccording to a Reuters report, Microsoft is working on bringing internal and third-party AI models to its 365 Copilot products. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the publication claimed that the Windows maker is now actively trying not to depend solely on OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) to offer AI solutions to its enterprise clients.\nIf true, this will be a big departure from Microsoft's existing AI strategy. The company invested $1 billion (roughly Rs. 8,519 crores) in OpenAI in 2019, followed by another $10 billion (roughly Rs. 85,195 crores) in 2023, as part of its ongoing partnership with the AI firm. The partnership allows Microsoft early access to all the AI models developed by the firm.\nAs per the report, the tech giant's biggest concern at the time is the cost and speed of the OpenAI-developed AI models. This is a significant sticking point since Microsoft does not use these AI models for internal usage, but the technology is used to build AI products for its enterprise clients.\n\"We incorporate various models from OpenAI and Microsoft depending on the product and experience,\" Microsoft told Reuters.\nTo diversify, the tech giant is reportedly looking at third-party AI models as well as ways to develop LLMs in-house.

The Japanese company, that produces popular game franchises like Sonic the Hedgehog, Persona and Yakuza, said it was currently assessing its options but could not disclose any details yet. If Sega were to launch a subscription service for games, it would join third-party publishers like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts in offering its titles digitally for a monthly fee.\nSega Considers Game Subscription Service\nThe publisher recently revealed its interest in launching a subscription service to the BBC. In an interview published over the weekend, Sega president Shuji Utsumi said he found subscription products “very interesting”, and confirmed the company was “evaluating some opportunities”.\n“We're thinking something - and discussing something - we cannot disclose right now,” he said.\nUtsumi did not reveal any details about a potential Sega subscription service, or share a launch timeline for the same. But the publisher boasts a healthy roster of iconic IPs, including Sonic, Yakuza, Virtua Fighter, Persona, Super Monkey Ball and more, that could make their way to the company's subscription service.\nSega's Metaphor: ReFantazio received six nominations at The Game Awards 2024\nPhoto Credit: Sega/ Atlus\nExisting Game Subscription Services\nThe subscription service model for games has taken off in gaming following the launch of Game Pass, with Sony launching a competing PlayStation Plus service that offers a library of hundreds of titles to members at no additional cost. Nintendo, too, has its own subscription service, called Nintendo Switch Online, for its hybrid console.\nAside from platform owners like Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, third-party publishers EA and Ubisoft offer their games on EA Play and Ubisoft+, respectively, in addition to traditional storefronts like Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation Store and the Xbox store.\nMedia and technology giants Netflix and Apple, too, have their own game subscription service for paying members. Netflix Games includes mobile titles for subscribers at no additional cost, while Apple Arcade brings games to subscribers across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\nSega has had successful year in games, releasing critically acclaimed titles like Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Metaphor: ReFantazio and Sonic X Shadow Generations in 2024. Metaphor was nominated in six categories at The Game Awards 2024, including the coveted Game of the Year Trophy. The RPG ended up with three wins in Best Narrative, Best Art Direction and Best RPG categories.\nIn the interview, Utsumi also said he intended to put Sega, an industry leader in the 1990s with its games and home consoles, on the path of revival.\n“I want to make Sega really shiny again,” he said. “Sega has been somehow losing confidence. But why? Sega has a great RPG group, Sega has amazing IPs, Sega is a really well-known brand.

{"title": "Ursid Meteor Shower: Best Viewing Tips for 2024", "text": "The Ursid meteor shower, the final celestial display of the year, is expected to reach its peak in the early hours of Sunday, December 22. This annual phenomenon which is active between December 17 and December 26, has its radiant in the constellation Ursa Minor, also called the Little Dipper. According to reports, the display will coincide with a last-quarter moon, which may limit visibility due to its brightness.\nViewing Expectations for 2024\nAstronomy experts have noted that the Ursid meteor shower typically produces a modest number of meteors, a report by Space.com highlights. As per In-the-Sky.org, under ideal conditions, around 10 meteors per hour may be observed. However, the moon's illumination, estimated to be at 54 percent, is expected to obscure fainter meteors, reducing the potential count to approximately five meteors per hour. Historical data shared by EarthSky highlights rare bursts of activity, including rates of 100 meteors per hour in 1945 and 1968.\nOrigins and Viewing Tips\nThe meteors, originating from the debris trail of Comet 8P/Tuttle, burn up as they enter Earth's atmosphere, creating bright streaks in the sky. Skywatchers are advised to seek dark locations away from city lights, allowing eyes to adjust to the darkness for better observation. Experts suggest looking slightly away from the radiant to catch meteors moving across the sky.\nUpcoming Celestial Events\nFollowing the Ursids, the Quadrantid meteor shower will mark the start of 2025's celestial events. It is anticipated to peak on the night of January 2 into the early hours of January 3. Both amateur and seasoned stargazers are encouraged to prepare for this more active meteor shower. Reports and expert recommendations have stressed that while the Ursids may not be the most prolific event, the opportunity for stargazing remains a captivating prelude to Christmas celebrations.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/ursid-meteor-shower-peaks-december-22-what-to-expect-in-2024-7306448", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T12:57:29", "language": "en", "description": "Catch the Ursid meteor shower on December 22.

{"title": "SpaceX to Launch Two Private Astronaut Missions to ISS with Vast Space", "text": "SpaceX has entered into an agreement with Vast Space to conduct two private astronaut missions to the International Space Station (ISS). The California-based Vast Space is reportedly working on its own private space station, Haven-1, which could be operational as early as next year. Both missions will utilise SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule, pending approval from NASA. The flights align with Vast Space's broader strategy to support payload and crewed missions to the ISS, according to a statement attributed to Max Haot, CEO of Vast Space.\nHaot noted that this approach facilitates collaboration with NASA and other international space agencies. The company has ambitions to advance human spaceflight capabilities through projects like Haven-2, an upgraded space station design expected to launch its first module by 2028.\nNASA's Role in Approving Private Astronaut Missions\nThe official blog have highlighted that NASA must approve all private astronaut missions (PAMs) to the ISS. Thus far, four such missions have been sanctioned, all proposed by Axiom Space and conducted with SpaceX as the transportation provider. Vast Space's plans for two new missions will need to pass similar scrutiny.\nVast Space's Haven-2 Vision for Low Earth Orbit\nVast Space is positioning Haven-2 as a future replacement for the ISS, which is expected to retire by 2030. The Haven-2 project has been submitted under NASA's Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destination program, an initiative aimed at fostering private space station development. Reports suggest that the first module of Haven-2 could be operational by 2028, potentially bridging the gap left by the ISS.\nIn a statement reportedly made by Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX President and COO, SpaceX expressed enthusiasm for expanding opportunities in human spaceflight. Vast Space's efforts were recognised as critical to broadening access to orbital destinations. Approval for these missions remains pending, but the collaboration between SpaceX and Vast Space reflects growing momentum in commercial space exploration initiatives.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/spacex-to-launch-two-private-astronaut-missions-to-iss-with-vast-space-7306555", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T12:51:30", "language": "en", "description": "SpaceX and Vast Space book two private astronaut missions to the ISS, pending NASA approval"}
{"title": "Best Smartphones of 2024: Apple iPhone 16, Vivo X Fold 3 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL and More", "text": "The premium smartphone segment, for nearly half a decade, has been dominated by Samsung and Apple. However, we saw a small shift a few years ago, with Vivo bringing in more premium products to India, while Google's Pixel series returned to the country with its Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro after a three-year hiatus. This year, the premium segment has been choc-a-bloc with smartphone brands, giving consumers a variety of devices and form factors to choose from. Apart from OnePlus and Vivo that have stuck with their premium offerings we also saw Oppo returning to the premium segment with its Find X8 and Find X8 Pro smartphones. Google, too, decided to bring all of its smartphones to India this year, which included its most expensive device to date, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nBe it book-style foldables, clamshell foldables or regular bar-shaped smartphones, there's enough variety in the premium segment in 2024, which includes a long list of all-rounders. But just because they are priced higher, it does not mean that we would wholeheartedly recommend all of them. So, here's a short list of the best smartphones from 2024 (in no particular order) that we would recommend to our readers.\nEach phone has something special about them that helps them stand out. So, if you are looking to bring in the new year with a new smartphone purchase, be sure to browse through this guide before you take the leap.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max\nClaiming to be Apple's first set of iPhones that have been designed from the ground up for Apple Intelligence, the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max comes with interesting upgrades. Apart from being physically bigger than the previous model, there's a bigger display with super skinny bezels, a brand-new dedicated Camera Control button and improved battery life along with some new camera and video recording tricks as well.\nWe aren't sure whether Apple will make the new Camera Control button a standard on all of its iPhones going forward. However, we are pretty sure that Apple isn't afraid to add more buttons to its iPhones, provided they bring some added functionality. In our review, the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max left us impressed with its raw performance, top-notch display, imaging prowess and battery life, even though it still looks and feels very much like last year's model. Charging is still relatively slow, and Apple Intelligence remains a promise that will hopefully keep up with Google's AI advancements when it's finally available to everyone in the coming year.\nApple iPhone 16\nDespite having some hardware shortcomings like slow charging and a standard 60Hz display, Apple's iPhone 16 is an excellent choice for those looking to upgrade from an older non-Pro iPhone model. Its display and software aren't going to feel any smoother when compared to your iPhone 15, but Apple has taken bigger strides by adding a new processor (Apple A18 instead of its top-end A18 Pro), which lets it deliver performance that will feel as good as the new Pro models.\nFor the past few years, Apple has chosen a processor from the previous year's Pro model for its new non-Pro iPhones. And since it did not hold back with its chipset this year, it also gets the new Camera Control button, along with various Apple Intelligence and photo editing features (some of which should arrive in the coming year). We received the iPhone 16 Plus model for review and were left impressed by its raw performance, camera performance and battery life. Camera performance is also noticeably better compared to the previous model.\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\nSamsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra may not look too different from last year's model, but it does have a few qualitative advancements under the hood. Its brighter display shows fewer reflections, which is good when viewing content outdoors. The cameras have improved, but we aren't big fans of the shift from a 10X telephoto camera (on the Galaxy S23 Ultra) to a 5X camera.\nLike with any other Galaxy devices, this one, too, is loaded to the brim with plenty of AI-enabled features that come under Samsung's Galaxy AI branding. Powering that experience is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, which, apart from Samsung's optimisations, is a better choice over the Exynos chips the brand uses in its [Galaxy S24] and [Galaxy S24+] models. Our review found its charging speed relatively slow, but you get 7 years of software and security updates. It's a big phone overall, but it's choc-a-block with features and delivers good battery life.\nMotorola Razr 50 Ultra\nMotorola's Razr 50 Ultra easily possesses the best clamshell foldable design to date. It takes design to the very extremes while offering premium features like an IP rating and wireless charging.\nWe are still fans of its floating cameras embedded into its large cover display that now has skinny borders all around. The phone has also lost some weight and is slimmer than the previous model. In our review, we found that performance was not a problem and the phone does manage heat well, save for when recording video.\nIts cover display design and software remain best in class. And Motorola's all added improved cameras (compared to the previous model), fast wired charging and finally, a battery that can last a full day without problems.\nVivo X Fold 3 Pro\nOne of the best book-style foldable designs we have seen this year, Vivo's X Fold 3 Pro also has the most sensible one as it offers a large (and slightly taller cover display), which makes way for a wider main display that is great for watching movies. Its design is also super slim, and that camera bump, while being thicker than Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6's camera modules, makes up for it when it comes to still camera performance.\nWhile Vivo FunTouch OS did have some rough edges when we reviewed the phone, the latest version with Android 15 squishes most bugs and adds some additional AI features to the mix. In terms of battery life, Vivo's foldable almost feels like a regular bar-shaped premium flagship as it can not only last beyond a day but can also charge up very fast at 100W, a lot higher than all the devices in this segment.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL\nGoogle has always struggled with performance with its Pixel Pro smartphone lineup. This year, the Pixel 9 Pro XL also came with a new Tensor G4 chipset with incremental updates, but it also added a vapour chamber cooling system that aimed to address all of those heating issues that we faced in the Pixel 7 Pro and even the 8 Pro series. With this in place, the Pixel 9 Pro XL now runs cooler even when using the camera, and this finally makes it easy to recommend to anyone who is looking for a premium smartphone with the cleanest software experience and a great set of cameras.\nIn our review, we found that the new Tensor G4 SoC also brings several new AI features and makes the existing ones a lot faster. Video Boost feature, which debuted with the Pixel 8 Pro, now works a lot better with the Pixel 9 Pro models, creating some impressively stable and clear low-light video recordings. But you will have to wait until the on-cloud processing is done, so be prepared for that. AI tricks aside, Google's Pixel 9 Pro XL is also one of the\nOppo Find X8\nOppo's Find X8 Pro did not make it to this list, but the smaller Find X8 sure stands out because it's a compact powerhouse available at a competitive price. There are just a handful of compact premium flagships in India, and Oppo's Find X8 stands out because it is the most feature-packed device in the segment.\nIn our review, we loved its design, which kept things simple and elegant with its flat display (with skinny borders) and flat sides. There's a capable processor onboard that can easily handle everything from games to imaging. Cameras are pretty good for its asking price, and with features like an IP69 rating, 50W wireless and 80W wired charging, they should quickly put it on top of your list when looking out for a sensible compact flagship.\nRealme GT 7 Pro\nRealme has always stood out because the brand tends to launch value for money products that are hard to beat. Realme's GT Pro series returned to the premium segment after a long break, but just like the previous GT Pro model, offers plenty of value for its asking price.\nIf performance is your thing, then look no further, as the Realme GT 7 Pro offers Qualcomm's latest and greatest offering at a low price. It looks like the part, as well as the GT 7 Pro, is a departure from the tacky designs that have plagued Realme flagships in the past. While we reviewed the Chinese phone variant, which has a substantially larger 6,500mAh battery, Realme claims to offer excellent battery life and charging speeds from the 5,800mAh unit. Camera performance is also quite sorted, which is a good thing, as past models were a bit shaky in this area.\nOnePlus 12\nThe OnePlus 12, given its pricing and features, is one of the most effortless smartphones to recommend in the premium segment. It has enough power and offers well-tuned and optimised software to take advantage of its high-resolution display.\nSmooth software experience aside, the cameras are great as well. It offers fast wired charging and, with the recent software update, several usable AI features. The only catch is that the OnePlus 13 is on its way to India, so we recommend holding on to this one, as the 13 is turning out to be a worthy replacement.\n​​\nVivo X200 Pro\nWith Oppo launching its Find X8 Pro, it was a bit surprising to see Vivo launch its X200 Pro flagship in India at the very end of 2024. The phone has a 3nm MediaTek processor that packs enough power for day-to-day tasks. It is up there with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, which is available in other high-end flagships.\nVivo's focus for the X series has always been camera performance, and things are no different this year. In our review, the phone managed photos that have excellent colour reproduction that remains consistent in every and any shooting scenario. The star of this show is the 200-megapixel telephoto camera, which manages excellent zoom images well beyond its native 3.9X optical zoom. The Zeiss collaboration goes a step further this year with the optics specialist joining hands for a Zeiss-calibrated colour display to go with its Zeiss-branded cameras.\n​​", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/mobiles/guide/best-mobile-phone-2024-7314447", "authors": ["Sheldon Pinto", "Edited Ketan Pratap"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T12:33:23", "language": "en", "description": "This year more than ever we have witnessed the launch of several Chinese smartphones in the premium segment.

However, rumours about the iPhone 18 series, slated to arrive in 2026, have also started to pop up. Most recently, TF Securities International analyst Ming-Chi Kuo opined that Apple will bring a powerful new iPhone camera technology with the iPhone 18 lineup that could significantly improve the image quality. The Cupertino-based company is said to offer variable aperture in the 2026 iPhone 18 lineup.\nIn a Medium post, Kuo shared details about Apple's iPhone 18 Pro. The analyst has reiterated his initial prediction that the iPhone 18 Pro series will sport a variable aperture camera. He states that BE Semiconductor (BESI) is the supplier of assembly equipment for aperture blades, a critical component of this upgrade.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro is likely to be the first Apple model to incorporate variable aperture on its main camera. With a variable aperture lens, users can adjust the amount of light that is captured. Android smartphones including Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Honor Magic 7 Pro offer this DSLR-style aperture control. Samsung introduced a variable aperture feature for the main camera back in 2018 with the Galaxy S9 series.\nFurther, Kuo states that Apple's M5 series chips will adopt TSMC's advanced N3P node. The mass production of M5, M5 Pro or Max, and M5 Ultra chips are expected to take place in the first half of 2025, second half of 2025 and 2026, respectively. The M5 Pro, Max, and Ultra are said to utilise SoIC packaging.\nAs per past leaks, Apple will integrate a new under-display Face ID technology in next year's iPhone 17 series. The iPhone 17 Pro models are said to be powered by Apple's A19 Pro chip alongside 12GB RAM, while the standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air could run on an A18 or A19 chip with support for 8GB RAM.

Its volume production is tipped to take place leveraging TSMC's 3nm semiconductor node (N3) which may offer performance gains and increased efficiency compared to the previous manufacturing process. Apple is also speculated to employ a new chipset design which could take up less space than conventional system-on-chip (SoC) architecture.\nApple's M5 Chip Development\nAccording to Ming-Chi Kuo, a supply chain analyst at TF International Securities, the standard M5 Apple silicon chip will enter mass production in the first half of 2025. Its development is tipped to be followed by its other family members such as the M5 Pro/Max and Ultra variants that may enter the fabrication stage in 2H25 and 2026, respectively.\nThe M5 chipset will be fabricated using TSMC's N3P node which could deliver a 5 percent performance gain while also reducing the power draw by 5-10 percent compared to M4 SoC's N3E node, as per Kuo. The Cupertino-based technology giant is expected to employ a “server-grade” System-on-Integrated-Chips-molding-Horizontal (SoIC-mH) design with its M5 Pro and Ultra chips that would have multiple integrated circuits integrated into a single unit, with chips being placed horizontally within the mould.\nThe analyst suggests that this unconventional design could take up 30-50 percent less space than conventional system-on-chip (SoC). This method is tipped to result in improved thermal performance and less throttling.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/laptops/news/m5-chipset-development-launch-cpu-design-apple-7319325", "authors": ["Shaurya Tomer", "Siddharth Suvarna"], "date_publish": "2024-12-24T09:51:29", "language": "en", "description": "Apple will kick off the mass production of its M5 family of chipsets next year, according to claims by a supply chain analyst."}

The next iteration of the wearable device is said to be launched as soon as next year, and screens may be leveraged to display notifications and perform other functions. Notably, this development builds upon Meta Platforms' ambition to develop lightweight wearable headsets that could potentially replace smartphones as primary computing devices.\nRay-Ban Meta Glasses With Displays\nAccording to a Financial Times report, the next iteration of Ray-Ban Meta Glasses (review) may be equipped with small screens that could be used to display notifications as well as responses to queries received from Meta AI — the company's artificial intelligence (AI)-powered virtual assistant.\nThe $299 (roughly Rs. 25,000) smart glasses, which have been developed in collaboration with EssilorLuxottica, come equipped with a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, open-ear speakers, and microphones which enable users to capture snapshots, listen to music, and have conversations — all on the go. The report suggests that while the first version of the displays on the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses would only show simple text and images, it would be a step towards realising CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of augmented reality (AR) glasses that “transpose a virtual world” upon real life.\nThis purported device could be launched as early as the second half of 2025, the publication adds.\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms is reported to continue developing Orion, its AR glasses that are equipped with holographic displays and feature support for Meta AI. The company unveiled its prototype at the Meta Connect 2024 event in September after nearly a decade of development. While this iteration wasn't made available commercially, the company is planning to introduce a version for customers within the next few years.\nAs per FT, the social media giant's ambitions have been bolstered due to the positive response towards its AR glasses and has reportedly fast-tracked its development to turn it into a consumer product. However, it faces several challenges, including developing a product that has adequate performance and decent battery life while being priced at a desirable price point.

{"title": "Tracing the Origins of Oaks: How Climate and Tectonic Changes Shaped Modern Trees", "text": "Rising global temperatures and shifting tectonic plates are believed to have shaped the development of one of Earth's most iconic trees, the oak (Quercus). According to reports, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a significant climatic event approximately 56 million years ago, created extreme conditions that influenced the evolution of diverse plant species, including the ancestors of modern oaks. This event occurred during a time of volcanic activity that released massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, leading to an average temperature increase of 8 degrees Celsius globally.\nThe Impact of the PETM on Early Ecosystems\nIt has been documented that the PETM caused dramatic changes in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. According to sources, tropical forests expanded across South America, while plant and animal species migrated vast distances in response to rising temperatures. The fossil record suggests that during this period, the ancestors of today's oaks began to emerge, though evidence such as acorns and pollen remains sparse.\nFirst Oak Fossils Discovered in Austria\nFossilised oak pollen was first identified in Oberndorf, Austria, near the site of the Church of Saint Pankraz. Reports indicate that this discovery provides the earliest evidence of oaks dating back to the PETM. The surrounding forests, a mosaic of subtropical and temperate species, were home to plants that later contributed to modern biodiversity.\nThe Evolutionary Split of Oaks", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/the-evolution-of-oak-trees-from-fossils-to-modern-forests-in-a-changing-world-7314296", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-23T22:48:18", "language": "en", "description": "Discover how oaks evolved from ancient fossils to the trees we know today, shaped by climate shifts"}

{"title": "Denmark Strait Cataract: World's Largest Underwater Waterfall Discovered", "text": "The Denmark Strait cataract, situated in the underwater channel between Iceland and Greenland, holds the distinction of being the largest waterfall on Earth. This submarine cascade drops an astonishing 11,500 feet (3,500 metres) from its summit to the ocean floor. With a vertical fall measuring 6,600 feet (2,000 metres), it towers over Angel Falls, the world's tallest land-based waterfall, which stands at just over 3,200 feet (979 metres). Despite its size, the Denmark Strait cataract remains concealed beneath the waves and undetectable from the surface.\nFormation During the Ice Age\nAccording to reports, this underwater phenomenon was formed during the last Ice Age, approximately 17,500 to 11,500 years ago. Glacial activity in the region shaped the sloping seabed, which now channels cold water from the Nordic Seas into the Irminger Sea. This process contributes significantly to the thermohaline circulation, a global system of ocean currents.\nIn a publication by Live Science, Professor Anna Sanchez Vidal of the University of Barcelona stated that while the cataract's effects are imperceptible at the surface, temperature and salinity data provide evidence of its activity.\nScale and Dynamics of the Waterfall", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/denmark-strait-cataract-worlds-largest-underwater-waterfall-discovered-7306621", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-23T22:26:18", "language": "en", "description": "Explore the Denmark Strait cataract, the world's largest underwater waterfall, found between Iceland and Greenland"}
{"title": "New Magnetic Survey Unveils Hidden Structures in Ancient Assyrian Capital of Khorsabad", "text": "A newly conducted magnetic survey has unveiled several previously unknown structures at the ancient Assyrian capital of Khorsabad in northern Iraq, according to reports. The site, dating back 2,700 years, was originally established as Dur-Sharrukin, or \"Fortress of Sargon,\" by Neo-Assyrian Emperor Sargon II in 713 B.C. The discoveries include a sprawling villa with 127 rooms, royal gardens, and a water gate, challenging earlier assumptions that the city was left largely incomplete before its abandonment in the eighth century B.C.\nDetails of the Survey and Findings\nThe findings, presented by Jörg Fassbinder, a geophysicist at Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich, during the American Geophysical Union (AGU) 2024 Annual Meeting, were obtained without excavation. A magnetometer was manually operated over 0.3 square kilometres of the site, revealing structures far beyond the previously excavated palace complex. The villa, described as being twice the size of the White House, and other features suggest a level of development previously unrecognised in Khorsabad.\nSarah Melville, a historian of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, commented in an email to Live Science that the non-invasive mapping technique provided valuable insights while preserving the integrity of the site. Melville's observations highlight the importance of using advanced tools to gain a more comprehensive understanding of historical capitals like Khorsabad.\nHistorical Context and Preservation Challenges\nSargon II's death in 705 B.C. resulted in the capital being abandoned as his successor, Sennacherib, shifted focus to Nineveh. While 19th- and early 20th-century excavations uncovered parts of the palace and iconic statues like the Lamassu, significant portions of the city remained unexplored. The site also suffered damage during looting by the Islamic State in 2015, with archaeological work resuming only after 2017.\nExperts, such as Daniele Morandi Bonacossi of the University of Udine, in their statement have noted that this research fills critical gaps by exploring non-monumental architecture and urban structures, providing evidence of a thriving community. The future of the newly identified structures remains uncertain, as further excavation decisions are awaited.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/new-magnetic-survey-reveals-ancient-assyrian-capital-s-hidden-structures-7306714", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-23T22:23:57", "language": "en", "description": "Magnetic survey uncovers villa, gardens, and gates in ancient Khorsabad, revealing city's growth"}
{"title": "UNSW Develops Miniature Sensor to Detect Nitrogen Dioxide with High Sensitivity", "text": "A highly sensitive miniature sensor capable of detecting nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) at low levels has been developed by a team of researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, according to reports. This compact device, measuring just 2 cm by 2 cm with a thickness of 0.4 mm, detects the toxic gas in real-time and operates without the need for an external power source. Its design aims to address size, cost, and energy consumption issues that are commonly associated with traditional gas sensors.\nUses and Limitations of Gas Sensors\nThe study was published in Advanced Science. Gas sensors are widely utilised for detecting hazardous gases in industrial, automotive, and healthcare settings. The monitoring of gases like carbon monoxide (CO) and NO₂ is crucial in areas such as factories and highways where emission levels are high, as reported in Advanced Science. These sensors are also employed in applications ranging from engine performance optimisation to medical diagnostics.\nChallenges like high energy consumption, large size, and sensitivity limitations have been longstanding issues in the field. According to Professor Dewei Chu, UNSW School of Materials Science and Engineering, in a statement, commercially available oxygen sensors can cost as much as $5,000 and often require operation at elevated temperatures, sometimes exceeding 300 degree Celsius.\nInnovative Approach Using Molybdenum Disulfide\nThe research team has used molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) as the core material for their sensor. This compound, known for its sustainability and biocompatibility, was modified by integrating nitrogen to improve its sensitivity. Reports indicate that the sensor achieves high sensitivity to NO₂ at concentrations as low as 10 parts per million (ppm), functioning effectively at room temperature.\nSustainable Production with 2D-Printing\nA novel 2D-printing technique was employed to construct the sensor. The process involves printing nanoscale materials onto a flat surface to form sensor electrodes and the sensing layer. Professor Chu highlighted the potential of this technology to lower production costs significantly.\nFuture Applications and Goals\nThe team intends to enhance the sensor's capabilities by testing it against other gases, including volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide, as noted in Advanced Science. Its compact size and energy efficiency make it suitable for wearable devices and safety systems in environments such as mines and warehouses.", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/miniature-sensor-detects-toxic-gas-no-in-real-time-with-low-energy-consumption-7306816", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-23T22:19:45", "language": "en", "description": "UNSW develops a compact, low-energy sensor to detect harmful nitrogen dioxide gas"}
{"title": "Chang'e-6 Mission Reveals Significant Reinforcement of Lunar Dynamo", "text": "The Chang'e-6 mission has provided new insights into the ancient lunar magnetic field. As reported in Nature, basalts from the moon's farside, dated to 2.8 billion years ago (Ga), show a notable resurgence in the lunar magnetic field's strength. These findings challenge prior beliefs about the lunar dynamo, suggesting an unexpectedly active phase in its evolution during this period. This study marks the first-ever paleomagnetic analysis conducted on farside lunar samples.\nThis work is published in Nature. Led by Professor Zhu Rixiang, a team at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) examined the samples returned by the mission. Associate Professor Cai Shuhui and her colleagues measured the magnetic field strength within these basalts, recording values ranging from 5 to 21 microteslas (µT).\nAccording to a report by Phys.org, this data indicates a sharp increase in the lunar magnetic field's intensity around 2.8 Ga, following a period of decline observed at approximately 3.1 Ga. The study's findings contradict earlier models that posited a sustained weakening of the lunar dynamo after 3 Ga, adding complexity to our understanding of the moon's thermal and geological history.\nProposed Drivers of Magnetic Activity\nThe resurgence of the magnetic field has been attributed to possible mechanisms, such as a basal magma ocean or precessional forces. Core crystallization may have also contributed to the prolonged activity. The researchers suggest these processes kept the moon's deep interior geologically active for a longer period than previously believed.\nImplications for Future Lunar Exploration", "url": "https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/change-6-mission-reveals-significant-reinforcement-of-lunar-dynamo-7306935", "authors": ["Gadgets 360 Staff"], "date_publish": "2024-12-23T22:16:17", "language": "en", "description": "Chang'e-6 mission uncovers new insights into lunar dynamo, revealing magnetic field strength at 2.8 Ga"}
